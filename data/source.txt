Mr. Smith leads them to the back of store where the two dogs are. One of them is a very big bulldog named Buster. The other is a very tiny chihuahua named Teacup.

April wants Teacup. Cody wants Buster. They walk outside to discuss.

They canâ€™t agree on a dog. April suggests they race home for it. The winner of the race chooses the dog.

Cody agrees, then tells April her shoelace is untied. When April looks down, he runs off and gets a head start.
