 In an Oct. N review of `` The <unk> '' at Chicago 's Goodman Theatre ( `` <unk> <unk> Take the <unk> in <unk> City , '' <unk> & Arts ) , the role of <unk> , played by Kim <unk> , was <unk> attributed to <unk> <unk> . 
 Ms. <unk> plays <unk> .

 Investors are <unk> to the Securities and Exchange Commission not to limit their access to information about stock purchases and sales by corporate insiders . 
 A SEC proposal to ease reporting requirements for some company executives would undermine the <unk> of information on insider trades as a <unk> tool , individual investors and professional money managers contend . 
 They make the argument in letters to the agency about rule changes proposed this past summer that , among other things , would exempt many <unk> executives from reporting trades in their own companies ' shares . 
 The proposed changes also would allow executives to report exercises of options later and less often . 
 Many of the letters maintain that investor confidence has been so shaken by the N stock market crash -- and the markets already so <unk> against the little guy -- that any decrease in information on <unk> patterns might prompt individuals to get out of stocks altogether . 
 `` The SEC has historically paid <unk> to the ideal of a level playing field , '' wrote <unk> S. <unk> of <unk> , Ill. , in one of the N letters the agency has received since the changes were proposed Aug. N . 
 `` Apparently the commission did not really believe in this ideal . '' 
 Currently , the rules force executives , directors and other corporate insiders to report purchases and sales of their companies ' shares within about a month after the transaction . 
 But about N % of the insiders , according to SEC figures , file their reports late . 
 The changes were proposed in an effort to streamline federal bureaucracy and boost compliance by the executives `` who are really calling the shots , '' said Brian Lane , special counsel at the SEC 's office of disclosure policy , which proposed the changes . 
 Investors , money managers and corporate officials had until today to comment on the proposals , and the issue has produced more mail than almost any other issue in memory , Mr. Lane said . 
 The SEC will probably vote on the proposal early next year , he said . 
 Not all those who wrote oppose the changes . 
 The Committee on Federal <unk> of Securities for the American Bar Association argues , for example , in its lengthy letter to the SEC , that the proposed changes `` would substantially improve the { law } by <unk> it more closely to contemporary business <unk> . '' 
 What the investors who oppose the proposed changes object to most is the effect they say the proposal would have on their ability to spot <unk> `` <unk> '' of trading activity -- buying or selling by more than one officer or director within a short period of time . 
 According to some estimates , the rule changes would cut insider filings by more than a third . 
 The SEC 's Mr. Lane <unk> disputed those estimates . 
 The rules will eliminate filings <unk> divisions , such as sales , marketing , finance and research and development , Mr. Lane said . 
 The proposed rules also would be tougher on the insiders still required to file reports , he said . 
 Companies would be compelled to publish in annual proxy statements the names of insiders who fail to file reports on time . 
 <unk> as a whole , Mr. Lane said , the filings required under the proposed rules `` will be at least as effective , if not more so , for investors following transactions . '' 
 But Robert <unk> , president of <unk> / Net , a North Miami , Fla. , company that packages and sells the <unk> data , said the proposal is <unk> so <unk> that key officials may fail to file the reports . 
 Many investors wrote asking the SEC to require insiders to report their purchases and sales immediately , not a month later . 
 But Mr. Lane said that while the SEC <unk> who files , the law tells them when to do so . 
 Investors who want to change the required timing should write their representatives in Congress , he added . 
 The SEC would likely be <unk> to legislation that required insiders to file transactions on a more timely basis , he said . 
 The nation 's largest pension fund , which oversees $ N billion for college employees , plans to offer two new investment options to its N million participants . 
 The <unk> Insurance and <unk> <unk> Retirement <unk> Fund said it will introduce a stock and bond fund that will invest in `` <unk> responsible '' companies , and a bond fund . 
 Both funds are expected to begin operation around March N , subject to Securities and Exchange Commission approval . 
 For its employees to sign up for the options , a college also must approve the plan . 
 Some N institutions are part of the pension fund . 
 The new options carry out part of an agreement that the pension fund , under pressure to relax its strict participation rules and to provide more investment options , reached with the SEC in December . 
 The new `` social choice '' fund will <unk> securities of companies linked to South Africa , nuclear power and in some cases , Northern Ireland . 
 Also <unk> will be investments in companies with `` significant '' business stemming from weapons manufacture , <unk> <unk> or tobacco . 
 <unk> percent of the fund will be invested in stocks , with the rest going into bonds or short-term investments . 
 The bond fund will invest in <unk> or <unk> bonds , mortgages or asset-backed securities , including as much as N % in foreign securities . 
 The fund also might buy and sell futures and options contracts , subject to approval by the New York State Insurance Department . 
 Under two new features , participants will be able to transfer money from the new funds to other investment funds or , if their jobs are terminated , receive cash from the funds . 
 The investment choices offered by the pension fund currently are limited to a stock fund , an <unk> and a money-market fund . 
 New <unk> Scientific Co. , a maker of biotechnology instrumentation and equipment , said it adopted an anti-takeover plan giving shareholders the right to purchase shares at half price under certain conditions . 
 The company said the plan , under review for some time , will protect shareholders against `` <unk> takeover tactics . 
 W. Ed Tyler , N years old , a senior vice president at this printing concern , was elected president of its technology group , a new position . 
 <unk> <unk> players have to be creative if they want to work a lot , because their <unk> and audience appeal are limited . 
 The <unk> <unk> <unk> has taken a hard line about the problem : He commissions and <unk> <unk> <unk> contemporary scores and does some conducting , so he does n't have to play the same <unk> and <unk> <unk> over and over again . 
 Richard Stoltzman has taken a <unk> , more <unk> approach . 
 <unk> ago , he <unk> with the new music <unk> Peter <unk> and Fred <unk> in the very <unk> chamber group <unk> , which won audiences over to <unk> contemporary scores like <unk> 's `` <unk> for the End of Time . '' 
 Today , the <unk> <unk> has mostly dropped the <unk> work ( though a touch of the old <unk> still <unk> ) and now goes on the road with piano , <unk> , a slide show , and a <unk> that ranges from light <unk> to light <unk> to light pop , with a few notable exceptions . 
 Just the thing for the <unk> set , the <unk> audience that has embraced New <unk> as its very own easy listening . 
 But you ca n't dismiss Mr. Stoltzman 's music or his <unk> as merely commercial and <unk> . 
 He believes in what he plays , and he plays <unk> . 
 His recent appearance at the Metropolitan Museum , dubbed `` A <unk> <unk> , '' was a case in point . 
 It felt more like a party , or a highly <unk> <unk> session with a few friends , than a <unk> concert . 
 <unk> in his trademark black <unk> suit , the <unk> <unk> announced that his new <unk> , `` <unk> <unk> , '' had just been released , that his family was in the front row , and that it was his mother 's <unk> , so he was going to play her favorite tune from the record . 
 He launched into <unk> 's `` The <unk> '' from `` Carnival of the <unk> , '' a favorite <unk> piece for <unk> , with lovely , <unk> tone and no <unk> . 
 Then , as if to show that he could play fast as well , he offered the second movement from <unk> 's <unk> for <unk> , a <unk> , <unk> <unk> that reflected the <unk> side of the Stoltzman <unk> . 
 And so it went through the first half : an <unk> chosen <unk> of pieces , none longer than five minutes , none that would <unk> or challenge a <unk> . 
 Mr. Stoltzman introduced his colleagues : Bill Douglas , <unk> / <unk> / <unk> and an old <unk> from Yale , and <unk> <unk> Eddie <unk> . 
 An <unk> section was built around pieces by Mr. Douglas , beginning with `` Golden <unk> , '' a <unk> , <unk> lead in to the <unk> `` <unk> , '' which gave Mr. Stoltzman the opportunity to <unk> in a high register and show off his fleet <unk> . 
 <unk> 's `` Air '' followed . 
 Mr. Stoltzman tied the <unk> in by <unk> him `` the great <unk> of the N century , '' and then built on the image by joining with Mr. Douglas in some <unk> two-part <unk> , <unk> arranged for <unk> and <unk> by Mr. Douglas . 
 <unk> the mood light , the two then <unk> and <unk> their way through some <unk> <unk> , devised by Mr. Douglas as an alternative to <unk> 's dry <unk> techniques , and then , with Mr. <unk> , soared and <unk> on the <unk> 's tight `` <unk> <unk> . '' 
 The end of the first half , however , brought what the <unk> crowd seemed to be waiting for : the pop singer <unk> Collins , who appears on `` <unk> <unk> . '' 
 <unk> and <unk> as ever , Ms. Collins sang <unk> Mitchell 's `` For Free '' -- about an <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , to which Mr. Stoltzman contributed a <unk> <unk> -- and Mr. Douglas 's <unk> setting of a <unk> blessing , `` <unk> <unk> . '' 
 `` <unk> <unk> '' also featured a slide show of lovely but predictable images of clouds , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc . 
 It was all too <unk> to be believed , but they probably would have gotten away with it , had they not felt compelled to add Ms. Collins 's signature tune , `` <unk> Grace , '' and ask for audience participation . 
 That went over the permissible line for warm and <unk> feelings . 
 <unk> this why some of the audience <unk> before or during the second half ? 
 Or was it because Ms. Collins had gone ? 
 Either way it was a <unk> , because Mr. <unk> offered the most substantial music of the evening just after <unk> : Steve Reich 's `` New York <unk> , '' one of a series of Reich works that <unk> a live performer with recorded tracks of his or her own playing . 
 ( Mr. Reich 's new `` <unk> <unk> '' for string <unk> uses the technique <unk> . ) 
 Mr. Stoltzman must have worried that his audience might not be able to take it : He warned us in advance that `` New York <unk> '' lasts N N minutes . 
 He also unfortunately <unk> this <unk> , <unk> <unk> with Mr. <unk> 's images , this time of <unk> or <unk> <unk> , in a <unk> <unk> of the musical structure that was <unk> <unk> from Mr. Reich 's piece and Mr. Stoltzman 's elegant execution of it . 
 The rest of the concert was more straight <unk> and <unk> sounds written by Charlie Parker , <unk> Coleman , Bill Douglas and Eddie <unk> , with pictures for the Douglas pieces . 
 It was <unk> to hear accomplished <unk> without having to sit in a <unk> club , but like the first half , much of it was easy to take and ultimately <unk> . 
 Is this the future of chamber music ? 
 Managers and <unk> insist that chamber music <unk> are a hard sell , but can audiences really enjoy them only if the music is <unk> of threatening elements , served up in <unk> <unk> and accompanied by <unk> ? 
 What 's next ? 
 <unk> to illustrate <unk> <unk> ? 
 It was not an <unk> evening , certainly , thanks to the high level of performance , the <unk> <unk> of Mr. Douglas , and the obvious <unk> with which Mr. Stoltzman chooses his <unk> . 
 But it was neither deep nor lasting : light entertainment that was no substitute for an evening of <unk> . 
 Ms. <unk> is a free-lance writer based in New York . 
 One of Ronald Reagan 's attributes as President was that he rarely gave his blessing to the <unk> that <unk> for `` consensus '' in various international institutions . 
 In fact , he <unk> the U.S. from one of the world 's most <unk> organizations -- UNESCO . 
 This is the U.N. group that managed to <unk> its own charter of promoting education , science and culture . 
 Ever since , the remaining members have been desperate for the United States to <unk> this <unk> group . 
 Now UNESCO <unk> are lobbying President Bush to <unk> on President Reagan 's decision to <unk> . 
 But we can think of many reasons to stay out for the foreseeable future and well beyond . 
 The U.S. , along with Britain and Singapore , left the agency when its <unk> <unk> , financial corruption and top leadership got out of hand . 
 The personal <unk> of agency Director <unk> <unk> drew much attention , such as when several of his top aides were uncovered as KGB plants and <unk> from France and when a <unk> office fire was set just before Congress sent accountants to <unk> U.S. funds . 
 Mr. <unk> was an extreme case , but even his replacement , the more personally <unk> Spanish <unk> <unk> Mayor , has had little success at <unk> reforms . 
 Several ridiculous projects continue , including the `` New International Economic Order , '' which means <unk> from the West to pay for everyone else 's <unk> . 
 The <unk> `` New World Information Order '' would give government officials rights against the press ; journalists would be <unk> to <unk> to their government , which would have licensing and <unk> powers and , indeed , duties to block printing of `` wrong '' ideas . 
 UNESCO somehow converted the founding U.N. <unk> of individual rights and <unk> into `` <unk> ' rights . '' 
 <unk> conferences were held to <unk> on subjects such as `` ethical responsibilities of scientists in support of <unk> '' and `` the impact of the activities of <unk> corporations . '' 
 The agency was so totally <unk> from the high principles of its founding that even the Soviets now wonder about an agency that seemed so <unk> to them . 
 <unk> may be partly responsible , but Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze last year admitted , `` The <unk> ideological approach undermined <unk> <unk> to UNESCO . '' 
 UNESCO is now holding its <unk> meetings in Paris to <unk> its next projects . 
 Mr. Mayor 's hope that <unk> to `` press freedom '' would survive <unk> seems <unk> to failure ; the current <unk> is `` <unk> the public and media to avoid manipulation . '' 
 He has n't been able to replace the <unk> <unk> . 
 Soviets remain in charge of education programs , a former head of an African military <unk> for executions is in charge of culture , and a hard-line Polish communist in <unk> directs the human-rights and peace division . 
 Of the agency 's N staff members , N are in the field working on actual projects , such as <unk> and <unk> research . 
 The position of the United States , which once contributed N % of the budget , is that nothing has changed . 
 John <unk> , the assistant secretary of state for international organizations , told Congress that the continuing `` <unk> , restrictive , <unk> '' programs make <unk> any time soon `` extremely unlikely . '' 
 This has n't much bothered the UNESCO <unk> , who last week could n't even agree to raise funds by selling off a fancy N French <unk> the agency somehow owns . 
 Other countries , including West Germany , may have a hard time <unk> continued membership . 
 We see an even stronger argument against UNESCO than its <unk> failure to reform . 
 This is that the Reagan <unk> <unk> Eastern Europe and <unk> Square shows the power of ideas <unk> by international civil <unk> or government <unk> . 
 Free markets , free minds and free elections have an appeal that seems to get <unk> only when delivered through U.N. organizations -- which of course are made up largely of governments that fear these principles at home . 
 The <unk> of the United Nations are experts at <unk> . 
 This can have its purposes at times , but there 's no reason to cloud the importance and <unk> of Western <unk> of freedom and justice . 
 We can see plenty of reasons to stay out , and none to <unk> UNESCO . 
 Researchers at Plant Genetic Systems N.V. in Belgium said they have developed a genetic engineering technique for creating hybrid plants for a number of key crops . 
 The researchers said they have isolated a plant gene that prevents the production of <unk> . 
 The gene thus can prevent a plant from <unk> itself . 
 Such so-called <unk> plants can then be <unk> by <unk> from another strain of the plant , thereby producing hybrid seed . 
 The new generation of plants will <unk> the <unk> , <unk> <unk> known as `` hybrid <unk> , '' similar to that now seen in hybrid corn . 
 `` The development could have a dramatic effect on farm production , especially cotton , '' said Murray Robinson , president of Delta & <unk> Land Co. , a <unk> Inc. subsidiary that is one of the largest cotton seed producers in the U.S. . 
 On a commercial scale , the <unk> of the <unk> male part has only been achieved in corn and <unk> feed <unk> . 
 That 's because the male part , the <unk> , and the female , the <unk> , are some distance apart on the corn plant . 
 In a <unk> process , the seed companies cut off the <unk> of each plant , making it male <unk> . 
 They <unk> a row of <unk> plants nearby , which then <unk> the <unk> plants . 
 The first hybrid corn seeds produced using this <unk> approach were introduced in the N and they <unk> as much as N % more corn than naturally <unk> plants . 
 The vast majority of the U.S. corn crop now is grown from hybrid seeds produced by seed companies . 
 A similar technique is almost impossible to apply to other crops , such as cotton , soybeans and rice . 
 The male part , the <unk> of the plant , and the female , the <unk> , of the same plant are within a fraction of an <unk> or even attached to each other . 
 The <unk> in these plants are difficult to <unk> off . 
 In China , a great number of workers are engaged in pulling out the male <unk> of rice plants using <unk> , and one-third of rice produced in that country is grown from hybrid seeds . 
 At Plant Genetic Systems , researchers have isolated a <unk> gene that can be <unk> in a plant to <unk> male <unk> . 
 Jan <unk> , research director , said this gene was successfully introduced in <unk> <unk> plants , a major crop in Europe and Canada , using as a carrier a `` <unk> gene '' developed by Robert Goldberg at the University of California in Los Angeles . 
 The <unk> gene is expressed just before the <unk> is about to develop and it <unk> the <unk> of every <unk> in the plant . 
 Mr. <unk> said this genetic manipulation does n't hurt the growth of that plant . 
 The researchers also pulled off a second genetic engineering <unk> in order to get <unk> plants in large enough numbers to produce a commercial hybrid seed crop . 
 They attached a second gene , for <unk> resistance , to the <unk> gene . 
 Both genes are then <unk> into a few greenhouse plants , which are then <unk> and allowed to mature and produce seed . 
 The laws of <unk> <unk> that half of the plants <unk> from these <unk> seeds will be male <unk> and <unk> <unk> and half will be male <unk> and <unk> susceptible . 
 The application of <unk> would kill off the <unk> plants , leaving a large field of <unk> plants that can be <unk> to produce hybrid seed . 
 Mr. <unk> said the hybrid <unk> created with this genetic engineering yield N % to N % more output than the commercial <unk> used currently . 
 `` This technique is applicable to a wide variety of crops , '' he said , and added that some modifications may be necessary to accommodate the <unk> of each type of crop . 
 He said the company is <unk> with the technique on <unk> , and plans to include cotton and corn , among other crops . 
 He said that even though virtually all corn seeds currently planted are <unk> , the genetic approach will <unk> the need for <unk> <unk> of <unk> , which costs U.S. seed producers about $ N million annually . 
 In recent years , demand for hybrid seeds has spurred research at a number of chemical and biotechnology companies , including Monsanto Co. , Shell Oil Co. and Eli Lilly & Co . 
 One technique developed by some of these companies involves a chemical <unk> supposed to kill only a plant 's <unk> . 
 But there have been problems with chemical <unk> damaging plants ' female <unk> <unk> and concern for the <unk> of such chemical <unk> to humans , animals and beneficial <unk> . 
 However , Paul <unk> , Monsanto 's director of plant <unk> , said the company 's chemical <unk> <unk> these problems and is `` <unk> on the female <unk> . '' 
 <unk> Genetics Corp. , <unk> , Calif. , is developing a <unk> containing a gene that spreads from cell to cell and <unk> with the genes that are responsible for producing <unk> . 
 This gene , called `` <unk> , '' is carried into the plant by a virus that remains active for a few days . 
 Robert <unk> , president of <unk> , called Plant Genetic 's approach `` interesting '' and `` novel , '' and `` <unk> rather than competitive . '' 
 `` There is a large market out there <unk> for hybrid seeds , '' he said . 
 Mr. Robinson of Delta & <unk> , the seed producer in Scott , <unk> , said Plant Genetic 's success in creating genetically engineered male <unk> does n't automatically mean it would be simple to create <unk> in all crops . 
 That 's because <unk> , while easy in corn because the carrier is wind , is more complex and involves <unk> as carriers in crops such as cotton . 
 `` It 's one thing to say you can <unk> , and another to then successfully <unk> the plant , '' he said . 
 Nevertheless , he said , he is negotiating with Plant Genetic to acquire the technology to try breeding hybrid cotton . 
 A bitter conflict with global implications has erupted between Nomura Securities Co. and Industrial Bank of Japan , two of the world 's most powerful financial companies . 
 The clash is a sign of a new <unk> and <unk> in Japan 's <unk> financial circles . 
 Not only are Japan 's financial institutions putting their enormous clout to work ; increasingly they 're <unk> off against one another in unprecedented public fashion . 
 Already , the consequences are being felt by other players in the financial markets -- even governments . 
 What triggered the latest clash was a <unk> over the timing of a New Zealand government bond issue . 
 Nomura was attempting to <unk> the N <unk> ( $ N million ) borrowing in Japan at a time when many Japanese banks , led by Industrial Bank of Japan , were <unk> the Wellington government to help them recover loans made to a defunct investment bank that had been owned by New Zealand 's <unk> pension fund . 
 <unk> to put up new money for New Zealand until those debts are repaid , most banks refused even to play administrative roles in the new financing , forcing an embarrassed Nomura to postpone it this week . 
 The dispute shows clearly the global power of Japan 's financial <unk> . 
 Aside from Nomura 's injured pride , the biggest victim so far has been the New Zealand government . 
 <unk> by its budget law from making any new domestic bond issues , Wellington 's <unk> Management Office had been casting abroad to raise the N billion New Zealand dollars ( US$ N billion ) to <unk> N billion it needs to come up with by the end of its fiscal year next June N . 
 With Japan 's <unk> banks <unk> against it , though , raising money may be difficult . 
 Not only can they block Wellington from raising money in Japan , bankers here say , but as the largest underwriters in the <unk> market , they might be able to scuttle borrowings there , too . 
 New Zealand 's finance minister , David <unk> , <unk> out at such suggestions . 
 He told reporters in Wellington Tuesday that the government had n't guaranteed the loans to <unk> New Zealand Ltd. , an investment bank N by the National <unk> Fund , and would n't bail it out . 
 `` It may very well be what the Japanese banks want , '' he told Radio New Zealand . 
 `` I think it would be irresponsible and I am not about to be <unk> by Japanese banks or any other international interests . '' 
 No less significant than the Japanese banks ' attempt to cut off funds to pressure a foreign government are the implications of a confrontation between Japan securities and banking industries . 
 <unk> is rising over recent government proposals to eventually lower the strict barriers that now separate -- and protect -- the two industries from each other . 
 Both sides are <unk> <unk> their turf , and relations have been at a <unk> for months . 
 The banks badly want to break into all aspects of the securities business . 
 Meanwhile , the securities companies -- most of them smaller than the banks -- are seeking access only to limited kinds of banking that would n't open them to the full <unk> of competition from the banks . 
 Nomura , the world 's biggest securities company largely by <unk> of its protected home field , and Industrial Bank of Japan , Japan 's most innovative and aggressive bank in capital markets abroad , <unk> the opposing sides . 
 And their <unk> of each other run deep . 
 In the past year , both have tried to stretch the limits of their businesses . 
 Nomura started a credit-card venture with American Express Co. that allowed <unk> to use their Nomura securities accounts like a bank account , attracting the <unk> of banks . 
 And Industrial Bank of Japan started up a London securities subsidiary that sells Japanese stocks to <unk> institutions overseas , a move that <unk> the anger of the stock brokerage firms . 
 The New Zealand bond issue simply has brought the two institutions face-to-face . 
 <unk> CORP. reported third-quarter earnings , which were <unk> shown in the <unk> Earnings <unk> table in yesterday 's edition to be lower than the average of analysts ' estimates . 
 On a pretax basis , <unk> 's third-quarter earnings of N cents a share were actually N % higher than the average of estimates . 
 Raymond E. Ross , N years old , formerly group vice president , U.S. plastics machinery , at this machine tool , plastics machinery and robots concern , was named senior vice president , industrial systems , succeeding David A. <unk> , who resigned Monday . 
 John A. <unk> Jr. , N , was named a managing director at this investment-banking company . 
 He will be in charge of research , equity sales and trading , and the syndicate operation of Rothschild . 
 Mr. <unk> was executive vice president and director of the equity division of the international division of Nikko Securities Co . 
 As <unk> <unk> might say , it 's <unk> <unk> all over again . 
 <unk> at <unk> , <unk> <unk> , once Oakland 's master <unk> , <unk> <unk> up a <unk> and <unk> it to second . 
 In the <unk> , Paul Blair , the <unk> ' <unk> Gold <unk> winner , <unk> <unk> a fly . 
 On the <unk> , former Red <unk> great Luis <unk> , the <unk> master of N moves , throws an <unk> strike . 
 `` <unk> , <unk> , '' <unk> their manager -- a fellow named <unk> <unk> , who , in a different time , handled four World Series teams and now handles the Gold Coast <unk> . 
 `` <unk> <unk> , '' he says . 
 Perhaps . 
 But for the next few months , these boys of <unk> long past are going to be <unk> in an Indian summer of the <unk> . 
 Now that the baseball season is officially over , you see , it 's time for a new season to begin . 
 Today is the debut of the <unk> Professional <unk> Association , a new <unk> pro sports circuit , <unk> after the highly successful senior tennis and golf <unk> and complete with good salaries , a cable television contract and even expansion plans . 
 One hundred and <unk> two former <unk> , near <unk> , hardly <unk> and <unk> begin a N , three-month season in <unk> <unk> up and down Florida . 
 For everyone involved , it 's one more <unk> of that <unk> of youth , baseball . 
 `` <unk> always makes you quit , '' says legendary St. Louis <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , the league 's commissioner . 
 `` You feel you want one more -- one more <unk> , one more hit , one more game . '' 
 Until the <unk> heroes of today <unk> these <unk> for spring training , there is one more . 
 And not just for the players . 
 It 's one more for the <unk> lawyers , accountants and real estate developers who <unk> up about $ N million each for the chance to be an owner , to step into the shoes of a Gene <unk> or have a beer with <unk> <unk> . 
 `` Nothing can be better than this , '' says Don <unk> , owner of the West <unk> Beach <unk> . 
 Early in the morning Mr. <unk> , an estate lawyer , <unk> over last <unk> and <unk> . 
 <unk> , he <unk> an <unk> uniform and , for fun , may field a <unk> from Dave <unk> . 
 It 's one more , too , for the fans who dream of a season that never ends . 
 `` I feel like a little <unk> , '' says a <unk> Alex de <unk> , a car salesman , who has stopped by a <unk> of the <unk> to slip six <unk> cards to the Great Man <unk> to be <unk> . 
 The league 's <unk> hope <unk> and tourists will join <unk> fans like Mr. de <unk> and pack the stands to see the <unk> . 
 The league is the <unk> of Colorado real estate developer James <unk> -- once a <unk> himself -- who says he had the idea last January while lying on a beach in Australia . 
 When he sent letters offering N retired major <unk> the chance of another season , N responded . 
 Eventually , about N made the trip to Florida to compete for the available <unk> . 
 ( <unk> have to be N or older , except for <unk> , who are eligible at N because life behind the plate is so rough . ) 
 For some players , the lure is money -- up to $ N a month . 
 Others , just released from the <unk> , hope the senior league will be their bridge back into the <unk> . 
 But as they <unk> <unk> that <unk> rather than <unk> , and <unk> old <unk> in the sun , it 's clear that most are there to make their fans <unk> again or <unk> the <unk> of seasons past or prove to themselves and their colleagues that they still have it -- or something close to it . 
 `` My <unk> is good . 
 Real good , '' says N Pete <unk> , working in the midday heat of the <unk> <unk> . 
 Mr. <unk> , who started with the <unk> Washington Senators , says that when he left baseball in N , he `` never looked back . '' 
 For a long time , he ignored baseball altogether , even the sports pages . 
 Now Mr. <unk> , a lawyer , claims he 'd play for free . 
 `` You ca n't give it up that easily , '' he says . 
 `` I tried . '' 
 The <unk> memory of one afternoon <unk> years ago drove Jim <unk> , a lean N <unk> to take a <unk> leave from selling insurance in Texas to try out for Mr. <unk> 's team . 
 `` It does n't replace pitching in the <unk> , but it proves to me that I would have been able to play if I 'd stayed healthy , '' he says . 
 Back in N , late in the season , a N Mr. <unk> made his only major league appearance , five and two-thirds <unk> for the Texas <unk> against the Chicago White <unk> . 
 He gave up seven hits , walked five and did n't get a decision . 
 <unk> troubles forced him back to the <unk> the next year . 
 `` There 's a satisfaction in going against the rules , '' offers Will <unk> , once a <unk> with Cincinnati 's Big Red <unk> . 
 He means the rule that a player ca n't cut it after a certain age . 
 These days he <unk> to <unk> jobs in his Chevy pickup before and after training with the <unk> . 
 While <unk> a beer after practice , he <unk> <unk> getting the Red <unk> 's Carl <unk> to pop out to end the N World Series , and <unk> the feat against the <unk> ' Roy White in N . 
 Some of the game 's <unk> <unk> <unk> the idea of <unk> men attempting a young man 's sport . 
 `` I personally do n't enjoy seeing players who I remember <unk> from their playing days running about and being <unk> about their deficiencies , '' says Roger <unk> , New <unk> magazine 's resident baseball <unk> . 
 `` I feel people should be allowed to remember players as they were . '' 
 Worse , says baseball author Lawrence <unk> , `` <unk> will get a heart attack and that will be the end of the whole story . '' 
 But the <unk> disagree . 
 Most are trim . 
 Some have been training for months ; others only recently left active status . 
 ( No one has worked out the players ' average age , but most appear to be in their late N . ) 
 And there 's pride . 
 `` I 'm not going to look <unk> , '' <unk> former Pittsburgh <unk> second <unk> <unk> <unk> , sweat <unk> his <unk> as he prepares for some practice swings . 
 `` It 's going to be a tough league , '' promises the N Mr. <unk> . 
 `` There will be a lot of <unk> . '' 
 Men who have played hard all their lives are n't about to change their habits , he says . 
 Nonetheless , one ca n't help wonder whether the game will be just a little bit slower . 
 At the <unk> <unk> Beach municipal stadium , Mr. Blair , the N former <unk> , knows his power is n't what it used to be .

 In a surprise move , the British government cleared the way for a bidding war for Jaguar PLC by agreeing to remove an obstacle to a takeover of the auto maker . 
 Trade and Industry Secretary Nicholas Ridley told the House of Commons yesterday that he will <unk> the government 's so-called golden share in the company as long as Jaguar shareholders agree . 
 The golden share <unk> any individual holding to N % and expires at the end of N . 
 It was in Jaguar 's best interests `` for the company 's future to be assured and the present climate of uncertainty resolved as quickly as possible , '' Mr. Ridley said . 
 Mr. Ridley 's decision fires the starting <unk> for perhaps a costly contest between the world 's auto giants for Britain 's leading luxury-car maker . 
 Both General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. have been trying to <unk> N % stakes in Jaguar . 
 Ford , which already has an unwelcome N % holding , is prepared to bid for the entire company and had <unk> the government to lift the takeover restrictions early . 
 GM has been negotiating a friendly transaction with Jaguar that likely would involve joint ventures and an eventual stake of just under N % . 
 But the government 's action , which caught Jaguar management <unk> , may scuttle the GM minority deal by forcing it to fight for all of Jaguar . 
 `` I ca n't believe they ( GM ) will let Ford have a free run , '' said Stephen Reitman , a European auto industry analyst at <unk> & Drew . 
 `` I am sure they will be going for a full bid . '' 
 Many investors certainly believe a bidding war is imminent . 
 Jaguar shares <unk> yesterday after Mr. Ridley 's announcement , following their temporary suspension on London 's Stock Exchange . 
 In late trading , the shares were up a <unk> N pence ( $ N ) -- a N % gain -- to a record N pence on very heavy volume of N million shares . 
 In the U.S. over-the-counter market , Jaguar shares trading as American <unk> <unk> closed at $ N , up $ N . 
 Analysts expect Ford will make the first move , perhaps today , with an initial offer of about N pence ( $ N ) a share . 
 Such a proposal values Jaguar at more than # N billion ( $ N billion ) . 
 <unk> about a takeover fight has sent Jaguar shares soaring in the past six weeks . 
 The share price was <unk> at about N pence before Ford 's Sept. N announcement of its interest in a minority stake . 
 Ford is `` in the driving seat at the moment , '' observed Bob Barber , an auto analyst at brokers James Capel & Co . 
 An aggressive Ford bid for Jaguar would put pressure on GM to make a better offer as the British company 's `` white knight . '' 
 Such a <unk> could end Jaguar 's hopes for remaining independent and <unk> . 
 But it is n't clear how long GM would be willing to fight Ford for Jaguar . 
 Because of their longstanding <unk> , GM just `` wants to make sure Ford pays a huge <unk> for ( Jaguar ) , '' said John Lawson , an auto analyst at London 's Nomura Research Institute . 
 People close to the <unk> talks agreed that Ford now may be able to shut out General Motors . 
 `` It 's either going to be a <unk> , or there only may be one player in town , '' one person said . 
 Another person close to the talks said , `` It is very hard to justify paying a silly price for Jaguar if an <unk> bidding war were to start now . '' 
 In a statement , Jaguar 's board said they `` were not <unk> about the ( Ridley decision ) in advance and were surprised at the action taken . '' 
 The statement emphasized that holders representing N % of the shares voting at a special shareholders ' meeting must agree to lift the takeover restrictions . 
 Jaguar officials in the U.S. noted that Ford , as Jaguar 's largest shareholder , now has the power to call for such a meeting . 
 U.S. auto analysts also noted that Ford is in the best position to benefit from the large number of Jaguar shares that have moved over the past month into the hands of arbitragers waiting for the highest takeover bid . 
 Jaguar 's own defenses against a hostile bid are weakened , analysts add , because fewer than N % of its shares are owned by employees and management . 
 Ford officials in the U.S. declined to comment on the British government 's action or on any plans to call a special Jaguar shareholders meeting . 
 But GM officials said they , too , were surprised by the move , which left them to `` consider all our options and explore matters further . '' 
 Although GM has U.S. approval to buy up to N % of Jaguar 's stock , it has n't yet disclosed how many shares it now owns . 
 In a prepared statement , GM suggested its plans for Jaguar would be more valuable in the long run than the initial <unk> investors might reap from a hostile Ford bid . 
 `` Our intensive discussions with Jaguar , at their invitation , '' GM said , `` have as their objectives to create a cooperative business relationship with Jaguar that would provide for the continued independence of this great British car company , to ensure a secure future for its employees and to provide an attractive long-term return for its shareholders . '' 
 Jaguar was shocked by Mr. Ridley 's decision , because management had believed the government would n't lift the golden share without consulting the company first . 
 Indeed , the government is taking a calculated risk . 
 Mr. Ridley 's announcement set off a <unk> of protests from members of the opposition Labor Party , who accused the Thatcher administration of backing down on promised protection for a privatized company . 
 The British government retained the single golden share after selling its stake in Jaguar in 
 The Conservative government 's decision may reflect its desire to shed a politically sensitive issue well before the next election , expected in late N . 
 `` It 's now a very good time politically to get this over and done with , '' observed Daniel Jones , professor of motor industry management at the University of <unk> in <unk> . 
 The government , already <unk> by high interest rates and a slowing economy , has been badly hurt by last week 's <unk> in Mrs. Thatcher 's cabinet . 
 At the same time , the government did n't want to appear to favor GM by allowing a minority stake that might preclude a full bid by Ford . 
 Mr. Ridley hinted at this <unk> in <unk> questions from members of Parliament after his announcement . 
 He said he was giving up the golden share `` to clear the way so the playing field is level between all <unk> . ''

 Yields on <unk> certificates of deposit dropped slightly in the week ended yesterday . 
 The average yield on a six-month CD of $ N or less was N % , compared with N % a week earlier . 
 The average one-year <unk> CD was down to N % from N % , according to Banxquote Money Markets , a New York information service that tracks CD yields . 
 `` This week was <unk> for the CD market , '' said <unk> Mehl , chairman of Banxquote . 
 `` The major banks have n't even reacted to sharp rises in the three-month Treasury bill rates '' in the past two weeks . 
 Banks that adjusted <unk> on CDs in the most recent week made only <unk> moves , he said . 
 The CD trend runs counter to the direction of short-term interest rates at the Treasury bill auction Monday . 
 The average six-month bill was sold with a yield of N % , up from N % . 
 The average three-month issue rose to N % from N % . 
 Typically , banks offer CD yields higher than those on Treasury bills , which are considered the <unk> short-term investments ; banks need a competitive edge to sell their products . 
 But when market interest rates move up rapidly , increases in bank CD yields sometimes lag . 
 Most yields on short-term jumbo CDs , those with denominations over $ N , also moved in the opposite direction of Treasury bill yields . 
 The average six-month yield on a jumbo CD was at N % , down from N % , Banxquote said . 
 For longer-term CDs , yields were up . 
 The average two-year and five-year <unk> were up N of a percentage point to N % and N % , respectively . 
 However , CDs sold through major broker-dealer networks were up slightly almost across the board . 
 The average six-month CD in that category added N percentage point to N % , for example . 
 Mr. Mehl attributed the rise specifically to the Treasury bill increase . 
 Among the major banks surveyed by Banxquote in six regions of the country , N % is the highest yield available . 
 It is offered by the flagship banks of New York 's Manufacturers Hanover Corp. in the one-year maturity only . 
 The yield is offered across a range of maturities at San Francisco 's BankAmerica Corp. and Wells Fargo & Co . 
 Just two weeks ago , BankAmerica 's yields in many of those maturities was N % . 
 Still , on average , the major California banks have the highest yields on CDs , according to Banxquote . 
 The average yield there on six-month issues is N % . 
 I had to reach back to French N when the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> over my shoulder during the coffee phase of dinner and asked whether I wanted to ride in a <unk> . 
 I was a last-minute ( read <unk> ) <unk> at a French journalism convention and so far the <unk> had been taken up entirely by eating , drinking , smoking , sleeping and drinking . 
 The man with the <unk> represented a <unk> attempt to introduce a bit of <unk> <unk> into our <unk> . 
 But as the French <unk> a <unk> state of <unk> when it comes to athletics ( try finding a <unk> machine in Paris ) , my fellow <unk> were having none of it . 
 The <unk> at my table simply <unk> more <unk> and <unk> at the suggestion of <unk> a perfectly good Saturday morning to go <unk> or even <unk> ( ballooning to you ; the brothers <unk> , French of course , were the world 's first <unk> <unk> ) . 
 Back in the U.S.A. this kind of <unk> <unk> activity wins <unk> <unk> responses . 
 As in : `` You went ballooning ? ? ! ! 
 In France ? ? ! ! '' 
 Americans it seems have followed Malcolm <unk> 's <unk> lead and taken to ballooning in a <unk> way . 
 During the past N years , the number of <unk> ( those who have passed a Federal Aviation Authority <unk> test ) have swelled from a couple hundred to several thousand , with some estimates running as high as N . 
 Some N balloon shows are held annually in the U.S. , including the world 's largest <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> -- the <unk> <unk> International <unk> <unk> that attracts some N enthusiasts and more than N <unk> , some of which are <unk> <unk> to resemble <unk> <unk> , <unk> or a N <unk> . 
 ( The <unk> balloon was denied official entry status this year . ) 
 But in <unk> , a gray N river town adjacent to France 's <unk> mountain region , none of these <unk> <unk> for things <unk> was evident . 
 <unk> at the de <unk> hour of N a.m. held all the attraction for most people of <unk> <unk> work . 
 <unk> the <unk> of a culture <unk> , I promptly signed up . 
 The first thing anybody will tell you about ballooning is that it requires <unk> in the way of athletic <unk> , or even a measure of <unk> . 
 ( So long as you do n't look down . ) 
 They will also tell you that even if you hate <unk> , you can still balloon . 
 ( I still say do n't look down . 
 At least not when you are <unk> . ) 
 What they wo n't tell you is not to go <unk> in anything you do n't want to get <unk> . 
 I 'm not referring to the traditional <unk> <unk> during the <unk> <unk> . 
 I 'm talking about landing in a <unk> . 
 In a <unk> <unk> basket . 
 With a pilot who speaks no English . 
 To <unk> , my <unk> <unk> ( and <unk> are referred to as <unk> ) began at <unk> on a <unk> <unk> and ended at noon in a <unk> field . 
 ( <unk> flights almost always occur at <unk> or <unk> , when the <unk> are <unk> . ) 
 In between came lots of coffee drinking while watching the <unk> <unk> and lots of standing around deciding who would fly in what balloon and in what order ( the baskets hold no more than four passengers ) . 
 When it was n't my turn in the balloon I followed its progress from the `` <unk> car , '' listening to the driver <unk> into a <unk> . 
 After long <unk> of this <unk> ground activity came N or so lovely minutes of <unk> above the <unk> watching the silver <unk> rise off the river and the French <unk> <unk> about the fields . 
 It 's hard not to feel that God 's in his <unk> with this kind of <unk> view of the world , even if your <unk> in silly <unk> <unk> kept pointing out how `` <unk> '' it all was . 
 Eventually little French farmers and their little French <unk> came out of their <unk> houses and put their hands above their tiny eyes and <unk> at us . 
 No wonder . 
 We were coming down straight into their <unk> . 
 See , the other rule of <unk> about ballooning is that you ca n't steer . 
 And neither can your pilot . 
 You can go only up or down ( by heating the balloon 's air with a propane <unk> , which does make the top of your head feel hot ) and ride the air <unk> . 
 Which makes the <unk> car necessary . 
 Most <unk> seldom go higher than N feet and most average a <unk> N miles an hour . 
 When the balloon is <unk> along at a steady <unk> there is little sense of motion . 
 Only when one is <unk> -- or in our case <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> -- does one feel , well , <unk> in a <unk> basket . 
 `` What 's he doing ? '' <unk> my companion , who was the only other <unk> member of the convention and whose <unk> were white . 
 `` <unk> , '' <unk> our pilot as our basket plunged into the <unk> . 
 `` You bet attention , '' I <unk> back , <unk> <unk> the propane tanks , `` I 'm wearing <unk> <unk> ! '' 
 Our pilot simply <unk> , fired up the <unk> and with another blast of <unk> lifted us , <unk> , a good N above the water level . 
 We <unk> along for a few feet before he plunged us into the drink again . 
 Eventually we came to rest in a <unk> <unk> of field where we had the <unk> pleasure of scrambling out of the basket into the <unk> while the French half of our ballooning <unk> team scrambled in .

 Back in the <unk> car , we drove around some more , got stuck in a <unk> , <unk> the aid of a local farmer to get out the <unk> <unk> and pull us out of the <unk> . 
 We finally <unk> with our balloon , which had come to rest on a <unk> road amid a <unk> of <unk> who watched us <unk> our <unk> -- another <unk> of <unk> activity -- that included the precision routine of <unk> the balloon to the ground , <unk> all the air out of it , rolling it up and <unk> it and the basket into the <unk> . 
 It was the most exercise we 'd had all morning and it was followed by our driving immediately to the <unk> <unk> hole . 
 This meant returning to the golf course , where we watched a few French <unk> <unk> the first <unk> while we sat under <unk> <unk> , me nursing an <unk> and my <unk> . 
 A whole morning of ballooning and I had been off the ground barely N minutes . 
 Still , I figured the event 's <unk> back in the U.S.A. was near <unk> . 
 As for the ride back to <unk> , our pilot and all the other <unk> passengers <unk> into the <unk> car . 
 My American companion and I were left to ride <unk> in the <unk> basket . 
 As we <unk> by a <unk> <unk> , I could n't resist <unk> up on my <unk> <unk> and <unk> .

 Treasury <unk> David Mulford defended the Treasury 's efforts this fall to drive down the value of the dollar , saying it helped minimize damage from the N drop in the stock market Oct. N . 
 <unk> before a House subcommittee , Mr. Mulford said that if the Treasury had n't intervened in foreign-exchange markets in September and early October to reduce the dollar 's value , the plunge in the stock market might have <unk> a steep fall in the currency that might have `` <unk> financial markets . '' 
 Mr. Mulford , responding to critics of intervention , also said intervention is `` highly visible , '' is taken seriously by financial markets and works better than `` was recognized some time ago . '' 
 <unk> between the Treasury and the Federal Reserve on the <unk> of intervention to help restrain the dollar <unk> at the hearing . 
 Fed Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson , who had <unk> from the Treasury 's policy , told lawmakers , `` I became convinced about what looked to me like an attempt to push the dollar down against the fundamentals in the market . '' 
 <unk> , he added , is useful only to smooth <unk> markets , not to fundamentally influence the dollar 's value . 
 Rep. John <unk> ( D. , N.Y . ) said Mr. Johnson refused to testify jointly with Mr. Mulford and instead asked to appear after the Treasury official had completed his testimony . 
 A Fed spokesman denied Mr. <unk> 's statement . 
 Mr. Mulford said reports of tension between the Treasury and Fed have been <unk> , insisting that they involved `` <unk> . '' 
 Mr. Johnson also said that `` in the scheme of things , these things are minor . '' 
 On other matters , Mr. Mulford said West Germany is contributing to imbalances in the world economy because of its success as an exporter . 
 `` The solution is stronger domestic growth { in Germany } , '' he said . 
 But because the growth of the German economy has been stronger than expected , Mr. Mulford said , it 's difficult for the U.S. to argue that Germany ought to adopt more <unk> monetary and fiscal policies . 
 Germany 's trade surplus is largely with other European countries rather than with the U.S. , Mr. Mulford acknowledged . 
 But nonetheless U.S. companies might be more successful in European markets if not for the German export push , he said . 
 Five officials of this investment banking firm were elected directors : E. <unk> <unk> III , a N managing director in the mergers and acquisitions department ; Michael R. <unk> , N , a managing director who directs the principal activities group which provides funding for leveraged acquisitions ; Richard <unk> , N , a general partner who heads the <unk> clearing services ; Michael <unk> , N , a general partner who is treasurer ; and William J. <unk> , N , a general partner who is also senior vice president of finance and chief financial officer . 
 The board increased by one to N members . 
 In the past year , one inside director resigned , while three others retired . 
 Some U.S. allies are complaining that President Bush is pushing <unk> talks too quickly , creating a risk that negotiators will make errors that could affect the security of Western Europe for years . 
 <unk> about the pace of the Vienna talks -- which are aimed at the destruction of some N weapons , as well as major reductions and <unk> of troops in central Europe -- also are being registered at the Pentagon . 
 Mr. Bush has called for an agreement by next September at the latest . 
 But some American defense officials believe the North Atlantic Treaty Organization should take more time to examine the long-term implications of the options being considered . 
 For one thing , Pentagon officials , who asked not to be identified , worry that the U.S. will have a much tougher time <unk> Europeans to keep some <unk> nuclear weapons on their soil once Soviet <unk> forces are <unk> out . 
 At the same time , they contend that a reduction of NATO forces under a treaty will increase the possibility of a conventional Soviet attack unless the West retains a <unk> force of nuclear weapons in Europe . 
 <unk> concerned about the deadline include the British , French and smaller NATO allies , some of whom do n't have adequate staffs to provide quick answers to the questions being raised by what generally are considered the most complex arms-control talks ever attempted . 
 So far , no ally has complained openly , preserving the impression that NATO is in line with the Bush position that a quick agreement bringing Soviet conventional forces down to parity with NATO is the West 's top bargaining priority . 
 But even though NATO negotiators have only N months left under the Bush timetable , they are still <unk> over such seemingly fundamental questions as `` What is a tank ? '' 
 Five of the six categories of weapons under negotiation have n't even been defined . 
 <unk> currently are defined as <unk> vehicles weighing N tons or more that carry large guns . 
 The Soviets complicated the issue by offering to include light tanks , which are as light as N tons . 
 <unk> A. <unk> , the chief Soviet negotiator in the <unk> talks , argued that this would mean the Soviets would have to destroy some N tanks , while the U.S. would lose none because it has no light tanks in Europe . 
 But the issue is <unk> than it seems . 
 France , Britain and Italy all have light tanks they would like to keep out of the talks . 
 And some U.S. Army analysts worry that the proposed Soviet <unk> is aimed at blocking the U.S. from developing lighter , more <unk> , high-technology tanks . 
 <unk> combat aircraft is even tougher . 
 The Soviets insisted that aircraft be brought into the talks , then argued for <unk> some N Russian planes because they are `` solely defensive . '' 
 NATO has n't <unk> from its insistence that any <unk> plane has offensive capability . 
 The dispute over that issue , according to one U.S. official , is a `` potential treaty <unk> , '' and only President Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev may be able to resolve it . 
 Accounting problems raise more <unk> issues . 
 Greece and Turkey , for example , are suspected of <unk> their <unk> in hopes that they can emerge from the <unk> treaty with large remaining forces to deter each other . 
 Other nations are n't sure how many weapons they have in their own <unk> . 
 `` It 's just going to be sloppy , both on our side and theirs { the Warsaw <unk> 's } , '' says one NATO analyst . 
 So far , neither the Bush administration nor arms-control experts in Congress seem moved by arguments that these problems may take more time to <unk> out than President Bush has allowed . 
 They argue that the bigger danger would be that the West would delay action so long that the Soviets might back away from the current <unk> attitude . 
 `` So what if you miss N tanks somewhere ? '' asks Rep. Norman <unk> ( D. , Wash. ) , a member of the House group that visited the talks in Vienna . 
 `` The bottom line is that if we can get that { Warsaw <unk> } <unk> brought down to parity , we ought to keep pressing ahead as quickly as possible . 
 I worry more about things becoming so unraveled on the other side that they might become unable to negotiate . 
 International <unk> Finance Corp. announced a leasing contract with charter carrier American Trans Air Inc. , in a transaction involving six Boeing Co. N . 
 The value of the <unk> , including <unk> , is in excess of $ N million . 
 Two of the N are new aircraft to be delivered to American Trans Air , the main subsidiary of <unk> Inc. , in December N and January N . 
 Four of the planes were purchased by International <unk> from Singapore Airlines in a previously announced transaction . 
 <unk> of the first aircraft is set for early November , a second for December and two for April N . 
 Norway 's unemployment rate for October was N % , unchanged from September but up from N % in the same month last year .

 Including those in the state programs , there were N <unk> , or about N % of the work force , without permanent employment in October , up from September 's N . 
 The number of people registered as jobless at the end of October declined by N from September to N . 
 Those employed in <unk> special programs increased by N to N in the same period , the <unk> said . 
 In October N , there were N fewer employed by government programs . 
 Coca-Cola Co. , aiming to boost soft-drink volume in Singapore , said it is discussing a joint venture with <unk> & <unk> Ltd. , its bottling franchisee in that country . 
 The venture would be the latest in Coke 's rapid expansion of overseas investment . 
 So far this year , it has put nearly $ N million into bottling operations in Australia , New Zealand and France . 
 The move also reflects Coke 's eagerness to have a hand in developing the soft-drink markets in Pacific <unk> countries . 
 Aside from Europe , the Pacific division is where Coke will be focusing much of its attention for years to come . 
 That 's because when Coke looks to the Pacific area , it sees an economic and <unk> gold mine . 
 In countries such as Taiwan , South Korea and Singapore , economies are growing , resulting in a rise in disposable income that consumers can use for soft drinks . 
 And unlike Europe and the U.S. , where <unk> are aging , the Pacific <unk> countries have growing <unk> of <unk> -- the heaviest consumers of Coca-Cola and other <unk> . 
 A Coca-Cola spokesman said it is too early to say how the joint venture would be structured , or how much the company would invest in the transaction . 
 In the past , however , Coke has typically taken a minority stake in such ventures . 
 By acquiring stakes in bottling companies in the U.S. and overseas , Coke has been able to improve <unk> ' efficiency and production , and in some cases , marketing . 
 Coke has <unk> to increase its control when results were sluggish in a given country . 
 That does n't appear to be the case in Singapore , a country of about three million people with a relatively high soft-drink consumption rate -- a key indicator of Coke 's success in a market . 
 In Singapore , <unk> consumption is about one-third that of the U.S. . 
 And combining <unk> & <unk> 's own soft drinks with Coca-Cola 's gives the Singapore company more than half the share of the soda market there , Coke said . 
 <unk> & <unk> , which also has interests in packaging , beer and dairy products , holds the Coke licenses for Malaysia and <unk> , where <unk> consumption is n't as high as in Singapore . 
 Coke could be interested in more quickly developing some of the <unk> potential in those markets . 
 A Coke spokesman said he could n't say whether that is the direction of the talks . 
 Coke said the joint-venture arrangement , which needs approval from both companies ' boards , should be completed early next year . 
 <unk> <unk> Inc. , Old Greenwich , Conn. , said it increased its quarterly N % to N cents a share from N cents , payable Dec. N to stock of record Nov. N . 
 The increase follows the company 's report of strong earnings for the third quarter , and reflects what American Brands called its `` tradition of sharing earnings growth '' with shareholders . 
 American Brands is a consumer products company with core businesses in tobacco , <unk> spirits and life insurance . 
 As of Sept. N , American Brands had N million shares outstanding . 
 Giovanni Agnelli & Co. announced a transaction that will strengthen its indirect control of Fiat S.p . A. and will admit Prince <unk> <unk> Khan as its first <unk> shareholder . 
 Giovanni Agnelli , a limited partnership that is the master holding company for Fiat 's Agnelli family , owns approximately N % of the shares in <unk> <unk> <unk> , which in turn owns approximately N % of Fiat , Italy 's biggest private-sector industrial group . 
 The company said Maria <unk> Agnelli <unk> , sister of Fiat Chairman Giovanni Agnelli , agreed to trade her shares in <unk> for new ordinary shares in the limited partnership , which will give her control of N % of Giovanni Agnelli & Co . 
 The <unk> Khan , meanwhile , agreed to trade some of his stake in <unk> <unk> S.A. , another Agnelli family company , for N % of Giovanni Agnelli & Co. 's capital . 
 His new stake would be in the form of preferred shares , which receive higher dividends but have voting rights only in extraordinary shareholders <unk> . 
 The <unk> Khan owns N % of <unk> 's capital , while <unk> owns N % . 
 As a result of the transaction , which is expected to be approved at a shareholders meeting Nov. N , Giovanni Agnelli & Co. will control N % of <unk> 's ordinary shares . 
 Its capital will also be raised to N billion lire ( $ N million ) from the current N billion lire . 
 <unk> also has <unk> preferred shares , which are quoted on the Milan stock exchange . 
 The value of the two transactions was n't disclosed , but an <unk> spokesman said no cash would change hands . 
 The move <unk> the existing links between the <unk> and the <unk> Khan , the head of the world 's <unk> <unk> who is a longtime family friend and frequently goes <unk> with Mr. Agnelli . 
 Mr. Agnelli and the <unk> Khan also have some business ties , and a spokesman for the Agnelli company did n't rule out that the current agreement could lead to further collaboration . 
 For instance , <unk> earlier this year bought an N % stake in <unk> , the <unk> Khan 's airline , which flies between Italy and <unk> . 
 Giovanni Agnelli & Co. , which was formed in January N as a way of keeping the <unk> ' controlling stake in Fiat together despite an <unk> family tree , has been playing a more active role in the Agnelli group of late . 
 It raised financing of N billion lire for the purchase this summer by another <unk> group of the food concern <unk> S.p . A. , by selling a chunk of its <unk> shares to <unk> S.p . A. 
 <unk> said during the weekend that it agreed to sell the shares back to Giovanni Agnelli for N billion lire .

 MCI Communications Corp. said it received a three-year contract valued at more than $ N million to provide network , credit-card and other telecommunications services to Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc . 
 Congressional Democrats and the Bush administration agreed on a compromise <unk> bill , opening the way for the first <unk> boost in more than nine years . 
 The agreement ended a long <unk> between the congressional leaders and the White House over the wage issue . 
 President Bush in June vetoed a measure passed by Congress and said he would n't accept any <unk> rise that went beyond limits he set early in this year 's debate on the issue . 
 The compromise was a somewhat <unk> version of what the White House had said it would accept . 
 Under the agreement with the House and Senate leaders , the minimum wage would rise from the current $ N an hour to $ N an hour by April N . 
 Employers could also pay a <unk> `` training wage '' for N days to new workers who are up to N years old , and then for another N days if the company <unk> a specific training program for the newcomers . 
 White House officials were delighted that the compromise includes the concept of a training wage , which Mr. Bush has fought for throughout the year . 
 `` For the first time in history , we have a training wage that will be part '' of the nation 's labor laws , said Roger <unk> , assistant to the president for economic and domestic policy . 
 White House aides said that although they made a small compromise on the length of a training wage , the final <unk> increase will meet the standards set by Mr. Bush . 
 The bill vetoed by the president in June , which the House failed to override , would have lifted the minimum wage to $ N an hour by late N , with a training wage for up to two months , generally for a worker 's first job . 
 Mr. Bush had been holding out for a bill boosting the wage floor to $ N an hour by the end of N , coupled with a six-month training wage for workers newly hired by any employer . 
 Under the compromise , the $ N level would be reached nine months earlier , while the training <unk> would be shorter , unless it is tied to a training plan . 
 Democrats argued that the training wage was a way of allowing employers to pay less than the minimum wage , while new workers need far less than six months to be trained for their jobs . 
 Democrats had been negotiating with some Republican congressional leaders on a compromise lately . 
 With congressional elections next year , GOP leaders have worried about opposing a <unk> rise for <unk> workers at a time when Congress is moving toward a capital-gains tax cut that would directly benefit <unk> taxpayers . 
 Republicans have been <unk> the White House to compromise on the wage issue . 
 In the Senate , Edward Kennedy ( D. , Mass. ) , chairman of the Labor Committee , and Pete <unk> , ( R. , <unk> . ) ranking minority member of the Budget Committee , have been working on a compromise , and their <unk> showed that the Senate appeared to be heading toward enough strength to override another Bush veto , a Democratic staff official said . 
 The House is scheduled to vote this week on the compromise , as a substitute to a new Democratic bill , itself <unk> down from last spring 's version . 
 The Senate will probably vote not long afterward . 
 Some Democrats thought they might have <unk> too much . 
 Rep. Austin Murphy ( D. , Pa. ) , chairman of the House labor standards subcommittee , said they might have done better `` if we 'd held their feet to the fire . '' 
 Mr. Kennedy suggested Democrats `` <unk> a great deal '' on the size of the increase , but he cited concessions from the White House on the training wage , which he said make it `` less harsh . '' 
 With only N to N eligible , N % of workers getting less than $ N an hour , who are adults , wo n't be subject to the training wage , he said . 
 The <unk> , which previously opposed the administration 's <unk> idea , said the compromise has `` adequate <unk> , so the youth are not <unk> and older workers are not <unk> . ''

 Moody 's Investors Service Inc. said it lowered the ratings on about $ N billion of Houston Lighting & Power Co. 's securities because of the company 's low levels of interest coverage and internal cash generation . 
 Houston Lighting is a unit of Houston Industries Inc. , a utility holding company in Houston . 
 <unk> by Moody 's were Houston Lighting 's <unk> bonds and secured <unk> bonds to N from N ; unsecured <unk> bonds to N from N ; preferred stock to N from N ; a shelf registration for preferred stock to a preliminary rating of N from a preliminary rating of N ; two shelf <unk> for collateralized debt securities to a preliminary rating of N from a preliminary rating of N , and the unit 's rating for commercial paper to N from N . 
 Moody 's said Houston Lighting 's current situation has some positive aspects , including managing `` very well '' the construction and commercial operation risks of <unk> N and N of the South Texas Project nuclear power plant . 
 Capital requirements will be declining and no new generating facilities will be required for several years , Moody 's said .

 Armstrong World Industries Inc. agreed in principle to sell its carpet operations to Shaw Industries Inc . 
 The price was n't disclosed but one analyst estimated that it was $ N million . 
 Armstrong , which has faced a takeover threat from the <unk> family of Canada since July , said that <unk> of the carpet business would improve `` total financial performance . '' 
 The move also would allow the company to concentrate on core businesses , which include ceramic <unk> , floor <unk> and furniture . 
 Moreover , such a sale could help Armstrong <unk> its investors and deter the <unk> , who own a N % stake in the <unk> , Pa. , company . 
 Analysts expect Armstrong to use proceeds of the sale to reduce debt , buy back stock or perhaps finance an acquisition . 
 The carpet division had N sales of $ N million , or almost N % of Armstrong 's $ N billion total revenue . 
 The company has been manufacturing carpet since N . 
 Recently it <unk> its plants so that it could make <unk> products with higher quality <unk> . 
 For the past year or two , the carpet division 's operating profit margins have <unk> around N % , high by industry standards , but disappointing compared with the N % to N % margins for two of Armstrong 's chief businesses , <unk> and building products . 
 Analysts hailed the planned transaction as being beneficial to Armstrong and Shaw , the market leader in the U.S. carpet industry , with an estimated N % to N % share . 
 Shaw , based in <unk> , Ga. , has annual sales of about $ N billion , and has economies of scale and lower <unk> costs that are expected to boost the profitability of Armstrong 's brands , sold under the Armstrong and <unk> names . 
 Yesterday , in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange , Shaw 's shares closed <unk> at $ N , up $ N . 
 Armstrong 's shares , also listed on the Big Board , closed at $ N , up N cents . 
 Yesterday , Armstrong reported flat earnings for the third quarter and nine months , <unk> by the stock <unk> of an employee stock ownership plan adopted earlier this year . 
 For the quarter , earnings were $ N million , or N cents a share , including a one-time gain of $ N million . 
 In the year-ago quarter , earnings were $ N million , or N cents a share . 
 Yesterday , Armstrong announced an agreement to sell its small Applied Color Systems unit to a subsidiary of the Swiss company , <unk> <unk> Ltd . 
 The price was n't disclosed . 
 Armstrong expects to close the sale of the color unit in late November and the carpet sale in December , with the gains to be applied to fourth quarter or first-quarter results . 
 The government 's primary <unk> gauge rose a slight N % in September , but economists said the report offered little new information on the degree to which the U.S. economy is slowing . 
 The small increase in the index of leading indicators , which had climbed N % in August but was unchanged in July , does lend support to the view that the economy has slowed <unk> . 
 However , it does n't give much of a <unk> as to whether a recession is on the horizon . 
 `` I do n't think it provides much new information on the economy , '' said Richard <unk> , economist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc . 
 So far this year , the index of leading indicators has risen in four months , fallen in four months and remained unchanged in the other month . 
 In another report yesterday , the Commerce Department said sales of new single-family houses plunged N % in September to an annual rate of N from N in August . 
 The declines were particularly pronounced in the Northeast and in the South , where Hurricane Hugo was a factor . 
 Although September 's weakness followed two strong months for home sales , the decline supports other indications that the drop in mortgage rates earlier this year has had only a limited beneficial effect on the housing market . 
 The September drop was the largest since a N % drop in January N , but monthly changes in this measure are even less <unk> than those in other economic indicators . 
 Because the figures are based on a small sample , the department said it is N % confident only that <unk> sales fell somewhere between N % and N % during the month . 
 The department also said it takes four months to establish a trend . 
 So far this year , N newly built homes have been sold , down N % from the like months of N . 
 The index of leading indicators got a major boost in September from a surge in consumer expectations as measured by the University of Michigan . 
 This measure had dropped sharply in August . 
 The Commerce Department said that as a result of a new adjustment to the formula used to <unk> the index , the influence of this component has been reduced . 
 Of the N components to the index , only three others rose in September : the money supply , the length of the average work week and stock prices . 
 Several components that track the health of the manufacturing sector of the economy turned down in September . 
 These include new orders for manufactured consumer goods , lead times on vendor deliveries , orders for new plant and equipment , and <unk> of orders for durable goods . 
 Meanwhile , the National Association of Manufacturers said yesterday a recent poll of N executives on its board found that N % do n't expect a recession to occur until N or later . 
 The remainder expect a downturn to begin sometime in 
 Although manufacturers often are quick to call for lower interest rates , N % of the executives said they would prefer that the Fed keep <unk> as its top priority even if that means higher rates . 
 The other N % said the Fed ought to worry less about inflation and bring interest rates down . 
 All the figures are adjusted to remove usual seasonal patterns . 
 Here are the net contributions of the components of the Commerce Department 's index of leading indicators . 
 After various adjustments , they produced a N % rise in the index for August and a N % rise for September . 
 September , and the change from August , are : from N in the previous month . 
 Boston Edison Co. said it will take a previously reported $ N million charge against earnings in the fourth quarter . 
 The charge resulted from a settlement approved yesterday by the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities . 
 As expected , the settlement limits rate increases for three years and ties future charges to customers for operation of the troubled <unk> Nuclear Power <unk> to that plant 's performance . 
 In its order , the state regulatory agency said the company `` must be held <unk> for the mistakes made in the management of the plant 's operation . ''

 Citicorp also said that the average rate rose to N % at its $ N million auction of N commercial paper from N % at last week 's sale . 
 Bids totaling $ N million were submitted .

 The bank holding company will auction another $ N million in each maturity next Tuesday . 
 An <unk> <unk> writing a <unk> about <unk> <unk> might <unk> a Clifford Stoll , but it 's unlikely . 
 It 's also unnecessary . 
 <unk> <unk> Clifford Stoll is a real person , or as he might <unk> put it , a <unk> person . 
 He is N , an <unk> with impressive credentials , and something of a <unk> at making computers do his bidding . 
 He once described himself as a `` Berkeley <unk> , '' and played the role well ; <unk> <unk> jeans , a <unk> of long hair and rejection of all things conventional , including , for a time at least , formal marriage to his `` <unk> , '' <unk> <unk> . 
 He also is an entertaining writer , combining <unk> and <unk> with <unk> detail and <unk> <unk> of how computers work . 
 In `` The <unk> 's Egg '' ( <unk> , N pages , $ N ) , he <unk> a remarkable tale of his efforts over N months to catch a computer spy . 
 The result last spring was the arrest by West German authorities of five young West Germans , accused of stealing information from computers in the U.S. and Europe and selling it to the Soviet KGB . 
 One of them , N <unk> Hess of <unk> , allegedly used the international telecommunications network to break into more than N <unk> computers in the U.S. , searching for secrets . 
 He probably did n't <unk> any <unk> files , but the KGB in East Berlin was willing to pay two of his associates , Peter Carl and <unk> <unk> , $ N for some of the material Hess collected . 
 They promised yet more for really good stuff . 
 Mr. Stoll draws his title from the <unk> 's <unk> of laying eggs in the <unk> of other <unk> , making them <unk> parents . 
 The computer spy had discovered that a popular <unk> / electronic mail program called <unk> could do <unk> with the widely used Unix operating system created by AT&T . 
 Using <unk> , the spy could substitute a <unk> `` <unk> '' program for the one that routinely <unk> up the Unix system every five minutes . 
 Once his <unk> 's egg was laid , he could enter Unix and become a `` <unk> , '' with access to everything . 
 Mr. Stoll was <unk> the <unk> at the <unk> <unk> of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in N when his grant ran low and he was asked to switch to helping run the <unk> 's computers . 
 He discovered a N <unk> in the charges made to various departments for computer time and <unk> it to a user named `` Hunter , '' who had no valid billing address . 
 Mr. Stoll suspected the <unk> was one of those <unk> students who has fun breaking into computers . 
 But after much tracking , it became evident to Mr. Stoll , through various <unk> , that the hacker was not on the Berkeley campus or even in California . 
 <unk> him became an <unk> for Mr. Stoll . 
 He made a midnight <unk> of all the printers he could lay hands on so that he could monitor all the telephone lines coming into the <unk> 's computers . 
 After <unk> that the hacker had taken over the <unk> account of a legitimate user named Joe <unk> , he <unk> up an alarm system , including a portable <unk> , to alert him when <unk> came on the line . 
 Some nights he <unk> under his desk . 
 His boss complained about <unk> of other chores . 
 The hacker was <unk> over the Berkeley files but also using Berkeley and other easily <unk> computers as stepping stones to the network of computers used by the military and national security agencies . 
 The White <unk> missile range and CIA contractor <unk> Inc. were among the targets . 
 When the hacker moved , Mr. Stoll moved too , calling up other systems managers to alert them but keeping his own system open to avoid <unk> <unk> . 
 Sometimes , if the hacker seemed to be into a sensitive file , he would drag his <unk> across the terminal to create <unk> or slow the system down to <unk> his <unk> . 
 The FBI initially showed little interest , and he had the impression other federal security agencies were <unk> up in legal red tape . 
 The CIA told him it does not do domestic <unk> . 
 One <unk> a lot from this book , or seems to , about <unk> federal bureaucracy . 
 `` <unk> to '' because it 's possible that the CIA and the National Security Agency were more interested than they let on to Mr. Stoll . 
 Finally , he got help . 
 <unk> is a major network linking computers . 
 One of its international specialists , Steve White , took a quick interest in Mr. Stoll 's <unk> , ultimately <unk> the hacker to West Germany . 
 The West Germans then took over and finally found <unk> Hess . 
 Eventually , Mr. Stoll was invited to both the CIA and <unk> to brief <unk> officers on computer theft . 
 He <unk> the humor of his <unk> appearance among these <unk> <unk> . 
 Back in Berkeley , he was <unk> <unk> by a <unk> lady friend for <unk> with such people . 
 He became angry in return . 
 He had developed a <unk> for the hacker and a <unk> appreciation of the federal `` <unk> '' who make national security their business .

 Mips Computer Systems Inc. today will unveil a new <unk> computer that will compete with more expensive machines from companies such as Sun Microsystems Inc. and Digital Equipment Corp . 
 The closely held Sunnyvale , Calif. , company also will announce an agreement to supply computers to Control Data Corp. , which will sell Mips machines under its own label . 
 The new Mips machine , called the N , will cost $ N for a basic system . 
 The computer processes N million instructions per second and uses only one central processing chip , unlike many rival machines using several processors . 
 The machine employs reduced <unk> computing , or RISC , technology . 
 At that price , an analyst familiar with the machine said , the computer offers up to N times the performance of similar machines . 
 `` In the price range it 's a <unk> <unk> product , '' said <unk> <unk> , an analyst at the <unk> firm <unk> . 
 The machine is part of an effort by Mips to establish itself as a supplier of computers , not just of <unk> technology . 
 Mips also wants to wedge into markets other than traditional RISC applications such as engineering ; Mips said the new machine will also be used by businesses and for communications . 
 `` This clearly demonstrates that Mips is a systems company rather than just a chip company , '' said Mips Vice President John <unk> . 
 The Control Data deal is a <unk> for Mips because it gives the the <unk> company one more ally as it <unk> more established electronic concerns such as Sun , Hewlett-Packard Co. , Motorola Inc. and Intel Corp. for the emerging market for RISC machines . 
 RISC technology speeds up a computer by <unk> the internal software . 
 For Mips , which expects revenue of $ N million this year , <unk> allies such as Control Data are essential to attract software developers to the company 's RISC architecture . 
 `` The thing it says about Mips is that they 're on a roll right now , '' said Ms. <unk> at <unk> . 
 `` They 're getting some major wins , '' she added . 
 Last month , for example , Mips agreed to supply its computers to <unk> Computer AG of West Germany and France 's <unk> Bull . 
 Sony Corp. , Tandem Computers Inc. and Digital Equipment have agreed to sell MIPS computers and companies such as Japan 's NEC Corp. and West Germany 's Siemens A.G. have agreed to make Mips chips under license . 
 Today 's agreement gives Control Data a machine to compete against Digital and other <unk> computer makers , said John <unk> , a <unk> analyst at <unk> Group Inc. of Boston . 
 The machine is essentially a mainframe computer , he said . 
 `` Suddenly <unk> ( Control Data ) has a competitive product to fight back against the N , '' a machine Digital announced last month , he added . 
 Control Data , based in Minneapolis , Minn. , expects its sales of Mips systems , including the new N , to amount to more than $ N million by the end of N , Mips said . 
 <unk> , Bull and others will also sell versions of the machine , said Mips President Robert Miller . 
 Mips will start shipping its new machine in the first quarter of N , he said . 
 The machine uses a single processor , which makes it easier to program than competing machines using several processors . 
 The computer can process N million calculations called <unk> operations every second . 
 The machine can run software written for other Mips computers , the company said . 
 Another fight is brewing between Congress and the Bush administration over how to pay for the savings-and-loan bailout without adding to the federal budget deficit . 
 In a hearing before the House Ways and Means Committee , the General Accounting Office and the Congressional Budget Office , which both are arms of Congress , advised the new S&L bailout agency to abandon plans to raise temporary working capital through debt issued from an agency that would n't be counted on the federal budget . 
 Officials of the Resolution Trust Corp. have said privately that such a plan was the most likely alternative to raise short-term cash for the bailout . 
 Instead , the <unk> and the Congressional Budget Office said , the RTC should consider using Treasury debt , which is less expensive and subject to oversight by Congress . 
 The spending could be <unk> from meeting deficit-reduction targets in the Gramm-Rudman budget law . 
 The RTC has projected that it will require between $ N billion to $ N billion in temporary working capital . 
 The borrowing to raise these funds would be paid off as assets of sick thrifts are sold . 
 The new S&L law allows the RTC to issue notes for as much as N % of the value of the assets it holds . 
 But higher interest rates paid on <unk> debt could add billions to the bailout costs , and would n't be subject to congressional scrutiny , Ways and Means members argued . 
 `` To allow this massive level of <unk> federal borrowing without prior congressional approval would be irresponsible , '' said Rep. <unk> <unk> ( D. , Calif. ) , who has introduced a bill to limit the RTC 's authority to issue debt . 
 The RTC will have to sell or merge hundreds of insolvent thrifts over the next three years . 
 The new S&L bailout law allows $ N billion to be spent to sell or merge sick S&Ls and their assets , but that is a net cost . 
 In the meantime , the agency must raise cash to maintain assets , such as real estate , until they can be sold . 
 Then the short-term debt is paid off through the proceeds of selling the assets . 
 David Mullins , assistant secretary of the Treasury , said that the working capital is necessary to reduce the final costs of the bailout , by allowing the agency to sell savings and loans without their bad assets , then hold the assets until they can be sold under favorable conditions . 
 He said it has n't yet been determined how the RTC will raise the cash , but the administration does n't want it to be included on the federal budget , because it would `` <unk> '' the budget process by requiring either <unk> from Gramm-Rudman or big increases in the budget deficit . 
 But the worst possibility would be raising no working capital , he said . 
 `` If working capital financing is not provided , '' he said , `` the RTC may have to slow { S&L sales } or dump acquired assets through fire sales . 
 <unk> Eastern Corp. said it applied , on behalf of two of its subsidiaries , to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for permission to build a N , $ N million pipeline system from <unk> County , Okla. , to <unk> , Miss . 
 The natural gas pipeline concern said the N million cubic feet a day capacity pipeline would be built by a proposed joint venture between two <unk> Eastern units - Texas Eastern <unk> Corp. and <unk> Gas Co . 
 Texas Eastern <unk> will build and operate the system , which will <unk> the <unk> <unk> with several interstate pipelines . 
 Now was that a quarter cup or a half cup ? 
 Not a <unk> question , unless you 're the <unk> <unk> of this city 's <unk> <unk> restaurant and you 've just lost your <unk> personal <unk> notebook . 
 <unk> <unk> was listed among the top N restaurants in the world this year by <unk> magazine . 
 The <unk> black <unk> , <unk> with N years ' worth of <unk> held together by rubber <unk> , was in <unk> <unk> <unk> 's <unk> when it was stolen from her house recently . 
 The Berkeley police do n't have any leads but doubt the crime was driven by a passion for <unk> . 
 Instead , they figure the <unk> probably took money from Ms. <unk> 's <unk> and <unk> all the tips in the <unk> <unk> . 
 <unk> <unk> , whose founder , <unk> <unk> , is considered the <unk> of the cooking style known as California <unk> and whose <unk> make reservations a month in advance , has n't exactly subjected <unk> to <unk> ice <unk> because of the theft . 
 For one thing , Ms. <unk> can draw on her <unk> , published by <unk> House four years ago , which is <unk> with <unk> for such <unk> as <unk> <unk> , <unk> fool ( a <unk> <unk> made with <unk> <unk> <unk> ) and <unk> `` <unk> a la <unk> . '' 
 For another , sympathetic fans have sent Ms. <unk> copies of her <unk> <unk> from magazines over the years . 
 Still , the restaurant 's <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> -- it supposedly has n't repeated a <unk> since opening in N -- requires constant <unk> . 
 And that puts added pressure on <unk> <unk> <unk> planners . 
 `` We make what we know how to make , '' says business manager Richard <unk> . 
 Many in the Bay Area 's <unk> community express <unk> that Ms. <unk> kept only one copy of such valuable notes , but she has received moral support from Baker 's Dozen , a group of California <unk> <unk> that meets regularly to discuss issues like how to keep <unk> from <unk> and how <unk> eating habits affect <unk> <unk> . 
 Ms. <unk> has offered a $ N reward for the book 's return but figures she 'll have to <unk> many <unk> from <unk> . 
 `` It 's an overwhelming job , '' she says . 
 `` There are so many possible <unk> when you consider how many things are made out of eggs and <unk> and milk . 
 Newport Electronics Inc. named a new slate of officers , a move that follows replacement of the company 's five incumbent directors last week . 
 Milton B. Hollander , N years old , was named chief executive officer , succeeding Barrett B. Weekes . 
 Mr. Hollander 's Stamford , <unk> High Technology Holding Co. acquired most of its N % stake in Newport in August . 
 Mr. Hollander was named chairman last week , succeeding Mr. Weekes , who was among the ousted directors . 
 The company has declined requests to discuss the changes , but Mr. Weekes has said that Mr. Hollander wanted to have his own team . 
 Scott <unk> was named president and chief operating officer of U.S. operations , titles that had been held by Mr. Weekes . 
 Mr. <unk> was vice president of the instrument and controls division of closely held <unk> Engineering Inc. , another company controlled by Mr. Hollander . 
 A company spokesman did n't know Mr. <unk> 's age . 
 James R. <unk> , N , vice president of Newport 's European operations , was named executive vice president and chief operating officer of European operations , assuming some former duties of Mr. Weekes . 
 Arthur B. <unk> , N , an attorney , was named secretary , succeeding John <unk> , who was another of the ousted directors . 
 <unk> Corp. declared a N stock split . 
 The Wilmington , Mass. , <unk> service company also boosted its quarterly dividend N % to three cents a share adjusted for the split . 
 The dividend had been five cents a share . 
 The split and quarterly dividend will be payable Jan. N to stock of record Nov. N , the company said . 
 The split will raise the number of shares outstanding to about N million . 
 Separately , <unk> reported that net income rose N % to $ N million , or N cents a share adjusted for the split , for the fourth quarter ended Aug. N . 
 A year earlier <unk> earned $ N million , or N cents a share adjusted for the split . 
 Sales rose to $ N million from $ N million . 
 <unk> Corp. said it completed the previously reported sale of approximately N acres of <unk> near <unk> , Calif. , to closely held Sierra Pacific Industries Corp. , <unk> , Calif. , for $ N million . 
 The <unk> , <unk> and <unk> concern said the transaction , which includes a swap of other <unk> interests , would result in a $ N million after-tax gain , to be recorded in the fourth quarter . 
 Healthcare International Inc. said it reached a N standstill agreement with its HealthVest affiliate calling for Healthcare to pay HealthVest $ N million right away and additional amounts in the future . 
 Under the agreement , Healthcare , a manager of health-care facilities , said it would pay HealthVest $ N million in overdue rent and mortgage payments and repay $ N million in funds that HealthVest advanced for construction work on facilities . 
 In return , HealthVest agreed that it wo n't exercise its rights and <unk> against Healthcare during the N period . 
 After the payment , Healthcare still will be $ N million in <unk> on rent and mortgage payments to HealthVest , a real estate investment trust whose portfolio consists largely of properties operated by Healthcare . 
 Healthcare has given HealthVest a N % note for that overdue amount , to be repaid over three years . 
 In addition , Healthcare agreed to make monthly rent and mortgage payments of $ N million to $ N million to HealthVest during the standstill period , to be paid when Healthcare successfully <unk> asset sales . 
 Because Healthcare actually owes HealthVest $ N million in rent and mortgage payments each month , the amount due above the amount paid will be added to the three-year note . 
 The funds should help ease a cash <unk> at HealthVest , which has been unable to pay its debts because Healthcare has n't made complete rent and mortgage payments since July . 
 A spokesman said HealthVest has paid two of the three banks it owed interest to in October and is in negotiations with the third bank . 
 Healthcare , which has been in a severe liquidity <unk> , said it is able to make the payments because it completed a transaction with <unk> <unk> Group Inc. in which <unk> purchased stock and warrants for $ N and <unk> Healthcare $ N million . 
 The loan is backed by Healthcare 's N % stake in HealthVest and interest in certain facilities . 
 I was pleased to note that your Oct. N <unk> Journal item recognized the <unk> concept as one of the significant events of the past century . 
 Actually , about two years ago , the Journal listed the creation of the money fund as one of the N most significant events in the world of finance in the N century . 
 But the Reserve Fund , America 's first money fund , was not named , nor were the <unk> of the <unk> concept , Harry Brown and myself . 
 We <unk> telephone redemptions , daily dividends , total elimination of share certificates and the constant $ N <unk> pricing , all of which were <unk> thought out and not the result of some <unk> on the part of the SEC .

 The <unk> moment in the career of Joseph F. O'Kicki came as N local and state <unk> packed into his elegant , <unk> courtroom here last year for his <unk> in as President Judge of Cambria County . 
 <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> his bench . 
 The local American <unk> color guard led the way . 
 As the judge marched down the center <unk> in his flowing black <unk> , he was <unk> by a <unk> <unk> . 
 To many , it was a <unk> more <unk> a king than a rural judge <unk> in the isolated <unk> of the southern <unk> <unk> . 
 But then Judge O'Kicki often behaved like a man who would be king -- and , some say , an <unk> and <unk> one . 
 While his case may be extreme , it reflects the <unk> of many small communities to <unk> judges . 
 Last March , nine months after the judge 's <unk> , the state attorney general 's office indicted him on a sweeping array of charges alleging more than N years of `` official <unk> '' in Cambria County , a depressed steel and mining community in western Pennsylvania . 
 The allegations , ranging from theft and bribery to <unk> and <unk> , <unk> a <unk> picture . 
 According to testimony in a public , N <unk> report handed up to the state attorney general , Judge O'Kicki <unk> cash from lawyers , <unk> favorable loans from banks and <unk> local businesses for more than a decade . 
 Prosecutors , in an indictment based on the grand jury 's report , maintain that at various times since N , he owned a secret and illegal interest in a beer <unk> ; <unk> hidden ownership interests in real estate that presented an alleged conflict of interest ; set up a <unk> corporation to buy a car and obtain insurance for his former girlfriend ( now his second wife ) ; and maintained N accounts in six banks in Cambria County . 
 In testimony recorded in the grand jury report , court employees said the judge , now N years old , <unk> his secretaries , made <unk> demands on his staff and <unk> anyone who crossed him . 
 <unk> claimed they were required to <unk> him to and from work , <unk> his lawn , <unk> his wood , fix his car and even drop by his house to feed his two grown <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . 
 One former <unk> charged that the judge <unk> him by <unk> on a promise of a better paying job after <unk> a $ N bribe . 
 Some of the allegations are simply <unk> . 
 Two former secretaries told the grand jury they were summoned to the judge 's <unk> on separate occasions to take <unk> , only to find the judge in his <unk> underwear . 
 One secretary testified that the judge once called her to his office while wearing nothing at all . 
 The judge , suspended from his bench pending his trial , which began this week , <unk> denies all the allegations against him , calling them `` <unk> '' and `` <unk> , political <unk> . '' 
 He blames the indictment on local political <unk> , <unk> with his aggressive efforts to clear the courthouse 's <unk> and a <unk> by state investigators and prosecutors angered by some of his <unk> against them . 
 `` I do n't know whose <unk> I 've stepped on , '' says the judge . 
 `` I 'll find out , eventually , who pushed the state police <unk> into action . '' 
 Even if only some of the allegations stand up , however , they provide ample testimony to the <unk> power of judges in rural communities . 
 That power can sometimes be abused , particularly since <unk> in smaller <unk> operate without many of the <unk> that serve as <unk> measures in urban areas . 
 Lawyers and their clients who frequently bring business to a country courthouse can expect to appear before the same judge year after year . 
 <unk> of <unk> that judge is pervasive , says Maurice <unk> , founder and director of the <unk> Justice Center in <unk> , <unk> , a public interest group that <unk> rural justice issues . 
 As a result , says Mr. <unk> , lawyers think twice before <unk> a judge 's ruling , are reluctant to mount , or even support , challenges against him for re-election and are usually <unk> to file complaints that might <unk> a judge 's integrity . 
 Judge O'Kicki , a <unk> and <unk> man , has been a <unk> in the local legal community for more than two decades . 
 The son of an <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> , he was raised in a small borough outside <unk> , the Cambria County seat , and put himself through the University of Pittsburgh Law School . 
 He <unk> near the top of his class , serving on the school law review with Richard Thornburgh , who went on to become governor of Pennsylvania and , now , U.S. Attorney General . 
 It was also in law school that Mr. O'Kicki and his first wife had the first of seven daughters . 
 He <unk> his first wife three years ago and married the daughter of his court clerk . 
 Last year , Pennsylvania Supreme Court Justice John P. <unk> called Mr. O'Kicki one of the <unk> judges `` not only in Pennsylvania but in the United States . '' 
 Clearly , the judge has had his share of <unk> . 
 After practicing law <unk> , he was elected to his first N term as judge in N ; in N , he was effectively <unk> . 
 <unk> years ago , Judge O'Kicki was voted president of the Pennsylvania Conference of State <unk> <unk> by the state 's N judges . 
 He has been considered several times for appointments to federal district and appellate court <unk> in Pennsylvania . 
 And when he ran unsuccessfully for a state appellate court seat in N , the Pennsylvania Bar Association rated him `` one of the best available , '' after <unk> local lawyers . 
 `` He probably was the <unk> guy who ever sat on our bench , '' says a former president of Cambria County 's N bar association , who , like most lawyers in Cambria County , <unk> to talk about the judge publicly . 
 `` He 's sharp as a <unk> . 
 He could grasp an issue with the <unk> of an eye . '' 
 For more than a decade , virtually no one complained about Judge O'Kicki . 
 `` What about those institutions that are supposed to be the <unk> of society , the banks and the bar association ... ? '' wrote a columnist for the <unk> , a newspaper in nearby <unk> , shortly after the scandal became public . 
 `` If only a banker or a lawyer had spoken out years ago , the judicial process would n't be under the <unk> it is today . '' 
 Officials with the Pennsylvania <unk> <unk> and Review Board , the arm of the state that <unk> judicial <unk> , counter that they had no <unk> of anything <unk> in <unk> . 
 `` Nobody told us ; nobody called us , '' says an official close to the case who asked not to be named . 
 `` Nobody had the <unk> to complain . '' 
 Certainly not the lawyers . 
 <unk> attorney Richard J. Green Jr. <unk> out $ N in loans to the judge over five years , he said in testimony to the grand jury . 
 `` The judge never made a <unk> of <unk> the money , '' said Mr. Green . 
 Eventually , Mr. Green testified , he began <unk> out of his office rather than face the judge when he visited . 
 When Mr. Green won a $ N verdict in a land <unk> case against the state in June N , he says Judge O'Kicki unexpectedly awarded him an additional $ N . 
 Mr. Green thought little of it , he told the grand jury , until the judge walked up to him after the courtroom had cleared and suggested a <unk> . 
 `` Do n't you think I ought to get a commission ... or part of your fee in this case ? '' Mr. Green said the judge asked him . 
 <unk> , Mr. Green never paid the money , he testified . 
 But he did n't complain to the state 's <unk> <unk> and Review Board , either , saying later that he feared <unk> . 
 Mr. O'Kicki said he will respond to Mr. Green 's <unk> at his trial . 
 Like most of Cambria County 's lawyers and residents who had dealings with the judge , Mr. Green declined to be interviewed for this article . 
 And no one with a complaint about the judge would allow his name to be printed . 
 `` I do n't have anything much to say , and I think that 's what you 're going to find from everyone else you talk to up here , '' says local attorney Edward F. <unk> . 
 Says another lawyer : `` The practice of law is a matter of <unk> one 's <unk> when you live in a small community . 
 One had best not dance on top of a <unk> until the <unk> is <unk> tightly shut . '' 
 The judge was considered <unk> , <unk> and ambitious , those who practiced before him say . 
 He <unk> tea sweetened with <unk> from his <unk> leather chair at his bench , while <unk> notes ordering <unk> to stop <unk> or to take off their hats in his courtroom . 
 Four years ago , he jailed all nine members of the Cambria County School Board for several hours after they <unk> his order to extend the school year by several weeks to make up for time lost during a teachers ' strike . 
 <unk> in his <unk> say he could cite precisely the years , months , weeks and days remaining until mandatory retirement would force aside the <unk> president judge , giving Judge O'Kicki the seniority required to take over as the county 's top court administrator . 
 The judge , they say , was fiercely proud of his <unk> and <unk> . 
 `` My name is judge , '' Judge O'Kicki told a car salesman in <unk> when he bought a new red Pontiac <unk> in October N , according to the <unk> report . 
 The dealership <unk> recorded the sale under the name `` Judge O'Kicki . '' 
 Yet , despite the judge 's <unk> bearing , no one ever had reason to suspect possible wrongdoing , says John <unk> , president of Cambria County 's N bar association . 
 `` The <unk> of a judge , his <unk> , the way he handles people are not a basis for filing a complaint , '' says Mr. <unk> . 
 `` Until this came up and hit the press , there was never any indication that he was doing anything wrong . '' 
 State investigators dispute that view now , particularly in light of the judge 's various business dealings in Cambria County . 
 The judge came under scrutiny in late N , after the state attorney general 's office launched an unrelated investigation into corruption in Cambria County . 
 The inquiry soon focused on the judge . 
 Even his routine business transactions caused trouble , according to the grand jury report . 
 When the judge bought his new <unk> from James E. Black <unk> in <unk> five years ago , the dealership had `` certain <unk> '' about the judge 's reputation , according to the <unk> report . 
 The dealership took the extra step of having all the paper work for the transaction <unk> by <unk> 's local lender , Laurel Bank . 
 Then , as an additional <unk> , the car dealership took the judge 's <unk> as he stood next to his new car with sales papers in hand -- proof that he had received the loan documents . 
 But when the judge received his payment book , he <unk> the deal . 
 `` There was no loan , there is no loan , there never shall be a loan , '' the judge wrote the bank on his judicial <unk> , according to the report . 
 Later , the judge went a step <unk> . 
 After Laurel Bank tried to <unk> the car , a vice president asked him to intervene in an unrelated legal dispute involving a trust account . 
 The judge wrote again . 
 `` I find myself in an adversary relationship with Laurel Bank , and I am not inclined to extend myself as far as any favors are concerned , '' the judge wrote back in a letter attached to the grand jury 's report . 
 `` Perhaps if my personal matters can be resolved with Laurel bank in the near future , I may be inclined to reconsider your request ... . '' 
 The judge now says it was `` unfortunate '' that he chose to write the letter but says `` there was certainly no intent to <unk> there . '' 
 The bank <unk> . 
 It <unk> the judge 's loan , lowered its interest rate and accepted a <unk> that had n't originally been part of the deal -- a beat up N Chevy <unk> the dealer had to repair before it could be <unk> . 
 The incident was n't the only time the judge got special treatment from his local bank . 
 Two years later , he wrote to complain that the interest he was paying on an unsecured $ N loan was `` absolutely onerous . '' 
 Paul L. Kane , Laurel 's president at the time , quickly responded . 
 The bank , he wrote back , was `` immediately '' lowering the rate by N % , `` as a <unk> to you . '' 
 The judge says he ca n't discuss in detail how he will defend himself at his trial , although he contends that if he were as <unk> as state prosecutors believe , he would be far <unk> than he is . 
 His <unk> <unk> and brick house outside of <unk> is up for sale to pay for his lawyers . 
 The judge says he is confident he will return to his old bench . 
 Already , he notes , the N charges originally filed against him have been trimmed to N . 
 Most of the allegations no longer pending were ethics charges withdrawn by state prosecutors as part of a pre-trial agreement . 
 The heart of the case -- `` official <unk> '' -- remains intact . 
 `` If I lose , I lose my position , my career , my pension , my home and my investments , '' says the judge . 
 `` My God and I know I am correct and innocent . 
 Many thanks for Alexander <unk> 's comic <unk> ( `` U.S. . <unk> : A House <unk> on <unk> <unk> , '' <unk> , Oct. N ) . 
 The use of the <unk> construction practices in the Soviet Union -- as <unk> by the collapse of sand apartment blocks during the <unk> earthquake -- as a <unk> for the U.S. economic system was a <unk> example of Mr. <unk> 's <unk> <unk> . 
 I await his <unk> : the economic and social <unk> of the San Francisco Bay area and the outstanding work of the local governments and the private charitable organizations there as <unk> for the <unk> of whatever failed system Mr. <unk> now believes in . 
 It should be a <unk> .

 As a money manager and a <unk> <unk> , I was very disappointed to read in the premiere issue of <unk> that The Wall Street Journal uses N metric tons of newsprint each year , but that only N % of it comes from <unk> paper . 
 By contrast , the Los Angeles Times , for example , uses N % <unk> paper . 
 With newspapers being the largest single component of solid waste in our <unk> , and with our country <unk> with trash , all sectors of our society and all types of businesses must become more responsible in our use and disposal of precious natural resources . 
 The Wall Street Journal is an excellent publication that I enjoy reading ( and must read ) daily .

 Mason is the largest <unk> <unk> in New England , with annual revenue of $ N million and N employees . 
 Mason serves commercial and government customers , including the National Institutes of Health . 
 The combined companies will become profitable by January N , said James P. <unk> , <unk> 's chairman and chief executive officer . 
 The Internal Revenue Service said it is willing to let the U.S. Tax Court decide how much oil man William Herbert Hunt will owe the government after his assets are liquidated . 
 The surprise announcement came after the IRS broke off negotiations with Mr. Hunt on a settlement of the one-time <unk> 's personal bankruptcy case . 
 Although the action <unk> one obstacle in the way of an overall settlement to the case , it also means that Mr. Hunt could be stripped of virtually all of his assets if the Tax Court rules against him in a N case heard earlier this year in Washington , <unk> . 
 The IRS has been seeking more than $ N million in back taxes from Mr. Hunt . 
 Separately , a federal judge hearing Mr. Hunt 's bankruptcy case yesterday turned down a proposed $ N million settlement between Mr. Hunt and Minpeco S.A. , another major creditor in the case . 
 The <unk> minerals concern had been seeking a claim of $ N million against Mr. Hunt . 
 In addition to turning down the compromise , Judge Harold C. Abramson said he would allow a claim of only $ N million . 
 Minpeco attorneys said they would appeal the decision to a federal district court . 
 <unk> Mr. Hunt 's taxes , he and the IRS have apparently agreed on a basic formula for <unk> his estate in which the IRS would get N % of the proceeds from a <unk> trust and N % would go to other creditors . 
 But they have been at odds over how much Mr. Hunt would owe the government after his assets are sold . 
 The IRS had demanded $ N million but Mr. Hunt would agree to no more than $ N million . 
 <unk> <unk> III , a government lawyer , warned that Mr. Hunt stood to lose certain oil and gas properties , $ N in English <unk> , a Colorado <unk> and other assets he might have kept if he had settled with the IRS . 
 `` But they wanted to roll the <unk> and we 're going to let them , '' Mr. <unk> said . 
 Stephen <unk> , Mr. Hunt 's attorney , said his client welcomed the gamble . 
 The Tax Court is n't expected to rule before early next year . 
 Japan has found another safe <unk> for its money : U.S. home mortgages . 
 An increasing number of big Japanese investors are buying up U.S. home mortgages that have been <unk> and packaged for sale as <unk> instruments known as mortgage-backed securities . 
 As much as N % of new U.S. mortgage securities issued by the Federal National Mortgage Association , or Fannie Mae , and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. , or Freddie Mac , now flow into Japanese hands . 
 That may not come as a surprise to Americans who have watched the Japanese <unk> up properties in the U.S. from golf courses to a stake in Rockefeller Center . 
 But it marks a big change for the Japanese , who <unk> mortgage securities after getting burned by a big downturn in interest rates a few years back . 
 `` You ca n't say it 's a `` <unk> '' ( <unk> wave ) , but we 're making some <unk> , '' says Fannie Mae 's chairman , David O. Maxwell , who visits Tokyo at least once a year to explain and drum up investor interest in mortgage securities . 
 `` Interest is a great deal higher than it was a year ago . '' 
 The steady growth of the mortgage securities market in the U.S. has even triggered talk of building up a similar market here . 
 <unk> of the growing Japanese demand for mortgage securities <unk> . 
 Earlier this year , Blackstone Group , a New York investment bank , had no trouble selling out a special $ N million <unk> trust it created for Japanese investors . 
 Industrial Bank of Japan , which claims to be the biggest Japanese buyer of U.S. mortgage securities , says it will more than double its purchases this year , to an amount one official puts at several billion dollars . 
 And a Fannie Mae <unk> this week promises to draw hundreds of prospective investors , who can be expected to channel tens of billions of dollars into the market in the next few years . 
 `` Last year , there were only several big investors who were interested , '' says <unk> <unk> , a vice president at the international arm of Nomura Securities Co . 
 `` This year , some investors are changing their policies and investing a lot . '' 
 <unk> , he says , strong demand could help to drive down interest rates on mortgage securities . 
 At the moment , Nomura is the only Japanese institution authorized to act as a primary seller of Fannie Mae instruments . 
 But other Japanese institutions say privately that they are considering asking to join the N selling group . 
 These securities are attractive to Japanese investors for three reasons . 
 First , they are safe . 
 While they are n't backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government , as Treasury bonds are , it is widely assumed that the government would support them if necessary . 
 ( U.S. Treasury bonds are still the <unk> investment of choice for long-term Japanese investors ) . 
 Second , they are liquid . 
 The secondary market in federally backed mortgage securities now exceeds $ N billion , or nearly half of the $ N trillion in U.S. residential mortgages issued . 
 Third , they offer high yields . 
 At the moment , some offer as much as N to N percentage points over Treasury securities of similar maturities . 
 But there is a risk , which the Japanese discovered when they first dipped their <unk> into the market nearly five years ago . 
 Since most mortgages can be prepaid or <unk> at any time , issuers of mortgage securities retain the right to buy back their bonds before maturity . 
 That 's a <unk> for long-term investors , since it forces them to reinvest their money -- usually at lower rates than the original mortgage securities carried . 
 `` Two or three years ago , the problem was that people did n't understand the <unk> risk , '' says Nomura 's Mr. <unk> . 
 `` So they were surprised and very disappointed by <unk> . '' 
 <unk> the trouble to Japanese investors , mortgage securities pay interest monthly , since most mortgages require homeowners to make monthly payments . 
 But Japanese institutional investors are used to quarterly or <unk> payments on their investments , so the monthly cash flow posed administrative problems . 
 As a result , Japanese investors <unk> clear of the mortgage securities . 
 But they did n't lose touch with the U.S. issuers . 
 Since N , Japanese investors have bought nearly N % of $ N billion in Fannie Mae corporate debt issued to foreigners , money that Fannie Mae uses to buy mortgages from U.S. banks . 
 And Japanese investors took up nearly all of two $ N million Real Estate Mortgage Investment <unk> , a kind of collateralized mortgage obligation , that were offered to foreigners this year . 
 In addition , further packaging of mortgage-backed securities , such as Blackstone 's fund , have reduced the effects of <unk> risk and automatically reinvest monthly payments so institutions do n't have to . 
 Freddie Mac for years has offered a so-called participation certificate that guarantees it wo n't be prepaid for a set number of years and offers <unk> payments . 
 As Georgia-Pacific 's bid for Great Northern Nekoosa has shown , <unk> takeovers are still alive despite <unk> reports of their demise . 
 <unk> , the debate about poison pills will continue to rage in the <unk> of corporations and the halls of <unk> . 
 Although poison pills come in different colors and <unk> , they usually give current shareholders the right to buy more stock of their corporation at a large discount if certain events occur -- typically , if a hostile bidder acquires more than a specified percentage of the corporation 's stock . 
 However , these discount purchase rights may generally be redeemed at a nominal cost by the corporation 's directors if they approve of a bidder . 
 <unk> of poison pills argue that their adoption forces bidders to negotiate with a corporation 's directors , who are thereby put in a better position to pursue the long-term interests of the corporation . 
 Recent studies by <unk> & Co. conclude that corporations with poison pills have experienced greater <unk> appreciation than corporations without poison pills during the past few years . 
 Critics of poison pills argue that they harm shareholders by letting corporate management defeat takeover bids at premium prices and by <unk> premium bids from ever being made to shareholders . 
 These critics are backed by several academic studies showing that the adoption of poison pills reduces shareholder values not merely in the short run , but also over longer periods . 
 Institutional investors that must evaluate poison pills on a regular basis are interested less in this general debate than in the answers to specific questions about the corporation issuing the pill . 
 Does this corporation have a high-quality management team with a good track record ? 
 Does this team have a viable strategy for improving shareholder values , and does this strategy require <unk> over an extended period ? 
 Will the adoption of this particular form of a poison pill significantly improve the chances for management to carry out this strategy ? 
 If the answers to these questions are <unk> , then institutional investors are likely to be <unk> <unk> toward a specific poison pill . 
 However , the problem is that once most poison pills are adopted , they survive forever . 
 Although the current management team may be outstanding , who will be the <unk> in N years ? 
 Although the five-year strategy may be excellent , what will be the strategy in N years ? 
 The solution to this problem is a <unk> poison pill . 
 The limit could range from three years to seven years , depending on the <unk> of the management team and the nature of its strategic plan . 
 At the end of this period , the poison pill would be eliminated automatically , unless a new poison pill were approved by the <unk> shareholders , who would have an opportunity to evaluate the corporation 's strategy and management team at that time . 
 One rare example of a <unk> poison pill is the shareholder rights plan adopted by Pennzoil last year after it received a huge litigation settlement from Texaco . 
 Pennzoil 's poison pill covers five years in order to give current management enough time to put these proceeds to work in a prudent manner . 
 Another interesting example is the poison pill adopted recently by <unk> National Intergroup Inc. , a diversified holding company . 
 The State of Wisconsin Investment Board , which owned about N % of the company 's voting stock , worked with management to <unk> a <unk> poison pill . 
 This pill automatically expires after three years unless continued by a vote of the shareholders . 
 The attitude of the Wisconsin Investment Board reflects a growing <unk> to <unk> poison pills on the part of institutional investors , as shown by the discussions at recent meetings of the Council of Institutional Investors and my informal survey of several retirement plans with large stock positions . 
 More widespread time limits on poison pills would allow shareholders to evaluate a specific poison pill within the context of a specific management team 's strategy . 
 Such concrete analysis is likely to lead to more <unk> dialogue between management and shareholders than the <unk> debate about poison pills . 
 Mr. <unk> is the general counsel and a managing director of Fidelity Investments in Boston . 
 Michael Blair , former president and chief executive officer of Enfield Corp. , failed to win election to the company 's board at a special shareholder meeting . 
 Mr. Blair said after the meeting that he had filed separate lawsuits in the Ontario Supreme Court for <unk> dismissal against Enfield and for libel against its largest shareholder , Canadian Express Ltd. , and two executives of Hees International Bancorp Inc. , which controls Canadian Express . 
 <unk> at the meeting elected a full slate of Canadian Express <unk> to Enfield 's N board . 
 Mr. Blair and Hees have been <unk> for months . 
 Yesterday 's election was a <unk> to Enfield 's annual meeting in June when Mr. Blair <unk> <unk> in favor of two Hees <unk> . 
 The Ontario Supreme Court <unk> Mr. Blair 's decision . 
 He later resigned from his executive positions with Enfield , saying that actions by its board `` amounted to { my } dismissal . '' 
 Mr. Blair said his libel suit seeks N million Canadian dollars ( US$ N million ) from Canadian Express and Hees executives <unk> Walt and <unk> <unk> . 
 He said his suit against Enfield seeks two years severance pay , equivalent to C$ N . 
 Hees and Canadian Express executives could n't be reached for comment . 
 Enfield is a holding company with interests in manufacturing concerns . 
 It is N % owned by Canadian Express , another holding company . 
 Hees is a merchant bank controlled by Toronto financiers Peter and Edward Bronfman . 
 All the concerns are based in Toronto . 
 Buying N % of Rockefeller Group Inc. is right up Mitsubishi Estate Co. 's <unk> in one sense : The huge Japanese real estate company is entering a long-term relationship with a similarly conservative U.S. owner of tony urban property . 
 But in another sense , the $ N million purchase is <unk> <unk> , industry analysts say . 
 The usually cautious giant will become the majority owner of the company that owns New York 's <unk> Rockefeller Center at a time when tensions over Japanese purchases of U.S. property are at an <unk> high . 
 Officials of Rockefeller Group and Mitsubishi Estate prefer to focus on the <unk> , nearly <unk> the threat of a <unk> from the U.S. public . 
 `` We think there will be positive as well as negative reactions , '' says Raymond <unk> , senior vice president and chief financial officer of Rockefeller Group . 
 `` On balance , we think it will be positive . '' 
 But some Japanese government officials and businessmen worry that the prominent purchase is just the sort of deal that should be avoided for the time being . 
 In particular , they criticize the timing , coming as it does on the heels of Sony Corp. 's controversial purchase of Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc . 
 `` <unk> , yes , we encourage the free flow of direct investment , '' says a Foreign Ministry official . 
 `` But they did n't have to choose this particular moment . '' 
 During the past year , government officials and leading business organizations have repeatedly urged Japanese companies to <unk> from <unk> real estate purchases in the 
 Since the N , Japan 's other major real estate purchases in the U.S. include <unk> <unk> America Corp. 's $ N million purchase of an office building at N East N St. in Manhattan in N and Mitsui <unk> Inc. 's $ N million purchase of the Exxon Building , part of Rockefeller Center , in N . 
 In Los Angeles , <unk> Plaza was sold to <unk> Corp. for $ N million in N , and <unk> Life Insurance Co. paid $ N million for Atlanta 's IBM Tower last year . 
 <unk> , annual Japanese investment in U.S. commercial real estate grew from about $ N billion in N to about $ N billion in N . 
 Many Japanese companies have taken the warnings by the country 's leaders to heart and sought development partnerships rather than landmark properties . 
 Critics say Mitsubishi Estate 's decision to buy into Rockefeller reflects the degree to which companies are <unk> by the pressure to act for the good of Japan . 
 `` Those who have no money and are n't buying think it 's right to <unk> , but those with money who want to buy for themselves pay no attention , '' says an official of the <unk> . Business Council . 
 But to Mitsubishi Estate , the acquisition has just the elements that should win support from both sides . 
 First of all , it is a friendly acquisition in which Rockefeller sought out Mitsubishi Estate and asked it to buy a majority share . 
 <unk> , the two companies found a <unk> in their business and development <unk> and intend to cooperate in a range of activities from real estate to telecommunications . 
 Finally , Mitsubishi Estate has no plans to interfere with Rockefeller 's management beyond taking a place on the board . 
 `` We 'll continue to work with them , in keeping with the reputation of the company , and we 'll rely very much on their leadership , '' says Mitsubishi Estate President <unk> <unk> . 
 Rockefeller may well have found its match in Mitsubishi Estate , a company of long history , strong government ties and sound resources . 
 In asset terms , Mitsubishi Estate is the largest real estate firm in Japan . 
 The core of its holdings is N square <unk> of <unk> expensive property in the <unk> district , the business and financial center of Tokyo , often <unk> called `` Mitsubishi <unk> . '' 
 The Mitsubishi family company acquired that property from the government some N years ago when it was a portion of <unk> residential land running from the <unk> of the Imperial <unk> east toward the <unk> of tiny shops and <unk> <unk> that made up the merchants ' district . 
 At the time , Japan had just opened its doors to the world after about N years of <unk> and needed a <unk> business center . 
 Mitsubishi built the government 's dream development , the story goes , in exchange for the official decision to <unk> Tokyo 's central <unk> station there . 
 That was just an early step in a relationship with government that has earned the Mitsubishi group the dubious <unk> of `` <unk> , '' literally <unk> , a title that has the <unk> <unk> of doing the government 's bidding , but also suggests the clout inherent in maintaining such close ties . 
 Mitsubishi Estate is one of the dozens of companies in today 's Mitsubishi group . 
 It 's known for its <unk> in part because it has had little need for bold overseas ventures : In the year ended March N , N % of its total revenue came from office building management . 
 Its earnings can rise N % to N % annually simply from the natural turnover of tenants and automatic rent increases , says <unk> McDonald , an industry analyst at James Capel Pacific Ltd . 
 For the latest fiscal year , the company 's net income jumped a robust N % to N billion yen ( $ N million ) . 
 For Mitsubishi Estate , the Rockefeller purchase will <unk> it firmly into the overseas real estate business , the one area where it has lagged notably behind Japanese competitors such as Mitsui , which had purchased the Exxon Building . 
 `` Japanese companies need to invest in overseas real estate for diversification , '' says <unk> <unk> , an industry analyst at Goldman Sachs ( Japan ) Corp . 
 Rockefeller is n't the first overseas purchase for Mitsubishi Estate -- it has already played a leading role in designing Los Angeles 's Citicorp Plaza . 
 But the Rockefeller investment is its largest . 
 Nonetheless , it will barely make a <unk> in Mitsubishi Estate 's finances , analysts say . 
 Mitsubishi Estate has n't decided how it will raise the funds for the purchase , which are due in cash next April , but the <unk> holdings alone are estimated to have a market value of as much as N trillion yen to N trillion yen . 
 Moreover , as a member of the Mitsubishi group , which is headed by one of Japan 's largest banks , it is sure to win a favorable loan . 
 Analysts say the company also could easily issue new convertible bonds or warrants . 
 Meanwhile , at home , Mitsubishi has control of some major projects . 
 It is the largest private-sector <unk> of the <unk> N project , a <unk> development in the port city of <unk> , about an hour outside Tokyo . 
 The project is one of a select group of public projects opened to U.S. firms under a <unk> construction trade agreement reached last year . 
 The centerpiece of that complex , the <unk> Tower , will be Japan 's <unk> building when it is completed in N . 
 Mitsubishi is also pushing ahead with a controversial plan to <unk> <unk> into a business center of high-tech buildings , a project <unk> for N years and six trillion yen . 
 Time Warner Inc. and Sony Corp. may be today 's public enemies , but the two entertainment giants could end up becoming partners in a number of ventures as part of a settlement of their <unk> legal dispute over Hollywood producers Peter Guber and Jon Peters . 
 The Warner Bros. studio and Sony signaled they are close to a settlement yesterday , asking a Los Angeles <unk> Court to postpone a hearing scheduled for tomorrow on Warner 's request for a preliminary injunction blocking Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters from taking the top posts at Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc . 
 In separate statements , the two sides said they want to have `` further discussions . '' 
 Sony is acquiring Columbia and Guber-Peters Entertainment Co. in two separate transactions valued at more than $ N billion . 
 Warner Communications Inc. , which is being acquired by Time Warner , has filed a $ N billion <unk> suit against Sony and the two producers . 
 Warner has a five-year exclusive contract with Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters that requires them to make movies exclusively at the Warner Bros. studio . 
 The two sides in the legal battle have <unk> accusations of <unk> at each other for weeks , and both Warner and Sony have accused each other of trying to <unk> each other 's prospects for success in the entertainment business . 
 But it may amount to little more than <unk> ; the two have continued <unk> , <unk> settlement talks over the last few weeks , and people familiar with the talks say the matter could be resolved within a week . 
 Both Warner and Sony declined to comment on the terms of the settlement discussions . 
 But the people familiar with the talks said that Warner is n't expected to get any cash in the settlement . 
 Instead , Sony is likely to agree to let Warner participate in certain of its businesses , such as the record club of Sony 's CBS Records unit . 
 Warner has <unk> Sony as the largest record company , but it does n't have a powerful world-wide record club like CBS . 
 The two sides are also discussing certain business ventures involving cable rights to Columbia 's movies . 
 In addition , Sony is expected to agree to swap Columbia 's N % stake in the <unk> <unk> , Calif. , studio that Warner and Columbia share , in exchange for the old MGM studio lot that Warner acquired with the purchase of <unk> <unk> Corp . 
 Still , it may be tough for the two to have a smooth partnership in anything , in the wake of sworn affidavits filed over the last week . 
 One , for example , came from CBS Records Chairman Walter <unk> , who will head a committee that will oversee Sony 's entertainment division , including both records and movies . 
 In his affidavit , Mr. <unk> accused Warner Chairman Steven J. Ross of having an `` <unk> , <unk> bias '' and said that Mr. Ross had tried to talk him out of letting Sony buy CBS Records two years ago for that reason . 
 Mr. Ross , who will be chairman and co-chief executive officer of Time Warner after the merger is complete , denied that in his own affidavit , and called Mr. <unk> 's remarks `` <unk> '' and his claims `` reckless , irresponsible and <unk> , '' saying Warner under his leadership has started a number of businesses in Japan . 
 Mr. Ross also said he enjoys `` warm professional and personal relationships '' with Japanese executives including Sony Chairman <unk> <unk> , `` who has visited my home here . '' 
 But despite the <unk> between Mr. Ross and Mr. <unk> , officials of the Time side of Time Warner have reportedly been increasingly interested in a settlement that might yield attractive business opportunities . 
 Time executives such as the company 's president , N.J . Nicholas , who will eventually be co-chief executive of Time Warner <unk> Mr. Ross , have no personal relationships or <unk> at stake in the fight over the Guber-Peters <unk> , and were never directly drawn into the fray . 
 <unk> between the two sides could <unk> , of course , as they have more than once since Sony announced its plans to hire Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters . 
 But both sides appear to be more willing now to meet each other 's terms to resolve the issue . 
 And although Warner has said it wanted the producers to fulfill the terms of their contract , the producers said in sworn court <unk> that they did n't believe the relationship could be repaired after the <unk> of the legal battle . 
 Any settlement is also expected to exclude Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters from any of the projects they were working on at Warner . 
 The Guber-Peters <unk> have N projects in various stages of development and production at Warner , including `` <unk> of the <unk> '' and `` A <unk> <unk> <unk> . '' 
 But that does n't mean Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters might not eventually get their hands on some of their projects ; studios develop hundreds of movies but produce only N to N each year . 
 Once a studio chooses not to actually make a movie that is in development , producers are typically free to take it elsewhere . 
 Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters also almost certainly would n't be able to participate in future <unk> to `` Batman , '' the <unk> hit they produced for Warner . 
 But in acquiring Guber-Peters Entertainment , Sony will actually get a piece of the profits from `` Batman , '' since the publicly held concern gets certain revenue from the movies Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters produce . 
 The two producers own a combined N % stake in Guber-Peters . 
 Southern Co. 's Gulf Power Co. subsidiary pleaded guilty to two felony charges of conspiracy to make illegal political contributions and tax evasion , and paid $ N in fines . 
 Gulf Power 's guilty plea before U.S. District Judge Robert L. <unk> yesterday marks the end of only one part of a <unk> inquiry of Southern Co . 
 The company is the subject of a federal grand jury investigation into whether its officials and its utility subsidiaries conspired to cover up their accounting for spare parts to <unk> federal income taxes . 
 `` The terms announced today are strictly between the United States and Gulf Power , '' said U.S. Attorney Robert L. <unk> . 
 `` This is only a further step in a lengthy investigation . '' 
 The plea settlement does not allow Southern Co. to charge any of the $ N to its customers , or take action against employees who provided information during the federal inquiry . 
 Gulf Power had been under investigation for violating the Utility Holding Company Act , which <unk> public utilities from making political contributions . 
 In a statement , Southern Co. President Edward L. Addison said , `` We believe our decision to plead ( guilty ) to these charges is responsible and proper . 
 And our action today will allow Gulf Power to avoid prolonged , <unk> legal proceedings . '' 
 He did not say what effect , if any , the $ N fine would have on the company 's earnings . 
 Mr. <unk> said yesterday 's plea by Gulf Power , which came after months of negotiations , was based on evidence that Gulf Power had set up an elaborate payment system through which it <unk> outside <unk> -- primarily three Florida advertising agencies -- for making illegal political contributions on its behalf . 
 The <unk> Agency , for example , allegedly made contributions from N to N to various funds for political candidates , then submitted bills to Gulf Power . 
 The contributions were funded by monthly payments of $ N to $ N to <unk> in the <unk> of a `` special production fee '' -- in effect , <unk> the nature of the payments from the Internal Revenue Service , federal prosecutors said . 
 The government also indicated that former Gulf Power senior vice president <unk> F. `` <unk> '' <unk> was the <unk> behind the use of the ad agencies -- <unk> , Dick Leonard Group II Inc. and <unk> & <unk> Corp. -- to make payments to various political candidates from N to N . 
 Mr. <unk> , who <unk> Gulf Power 's <unk> efforts , died <unk> in a plane crash in April after learning he might be fired following the <unk> of <unk> in a company audit . 
 Government officials declined to say whether the investigation includes the ad agencies or the politicians involved .

 <unk> <unk> a bigger piece of the declining <unk> market , Seagram Co. has launched a controversial `` frequent <unk> '' promotion for its Chivas <unk> brand . 
 Under the program , dubbed Chivas Class , customers who send in two labels from Chivas bottles will receive an upgrade in <unk> class on some Trans World Airlines flights . 
 <unk> customers also can purchase luxury items at reduced prices . 
 But at a time of mounting concern over alcohol abuse , some liquor marketers consider Seagram 's frequent buyer promotion risky . 
 `` I 'm surprised they 're doing this , '' says Penn <unk> , president of <unk> & <unk> Co. , which markets <unk> Walker <unk> . 
 `` I would be very <unk> of anything that says if you drink more , you get more . '' 
 Others question the impact on Chivas 's upscale image of a promotion that has customers <unk> off labels . 
 `` It 's really <unk> , '' says Albert <unk> , creative director at the Wells Rich Greene ad agency . 
 `` Chivas has an image of something you would <unk> , rather than <unk> . '' 
 Chivas Class is n't the first such promotion . 
 Last year , <unk> <unk> offered N <unk> frequent <unk> miles in exchange for a label . 
 And <unk> 's gave discounts on Scottish merchandise to people who sent in <unk> labels . 
 But the scope of Seagram 's Chivas promotion sets it apart . 
 The current campaign is just the first leg of an aggressive <unk> direct marketing plan . 
 Seagram says the promotion is designed to build brand loyalty rather than promote heavy drinking . 
 Seagram asks customers to buy only two or three bottles over a N period , says Richard Shaw , vice president of U.S. direct marketing . 
 `` We 're not asking them to save up N <unk> . 
 We 're not saying drink more , we 're saying trade up . ''

 But <unk> Foods Inc. believes it can milk some sales by <unk> the trend .

 <unk> displays in department stores were often <unk> and <unk> . 
 And the merchandise was , well , fake . 
 As a result , marketers of <unk> <unk> steadily lost space in department stores to more fashionable rivals -- cosmetics makers . 
 But lately , retailers say , fake has become more fashionable . 
 And jewelry makers are beginning to use many of the same marketing <unk> <unk> in the aggressive world of cosmetics . 
 Last year , the total women 's fashion jewelry business topped $ N billion , says Karen <unk> , editor of <unk> magazine . 
 And it 's growing fast , with annual sales gains of more than N % . 
 To increase their share of that business , jewelry makers such as <unk> Brands Inc. 's <unk> and <unk> units and <unk> Inc. , maker of Anne Klein jewelry , are launching new lines with as much <unk> as the <unk> companies . 
 They 're hiring models to <unk> the <unk> <unk> their <unk> , and they 're even beginning to borrow a <unk> favorite of the beauty business -- offering a gift when consumers make a purchase .

 Northwest , a unit of NWA Inc. , and McDonnell Douglas Corp. , which made the N aircraft , also are pursuing <unk> against each other in the crash near Detroit Metropolitan Airport . 
 Terms of the settlements for the remaining N lawsuits against Northwest were n't disclosed . 
 A total of N lawsuits were filed on behalf of crash victims . 
 U.S. District Judge <unk> A. <unk> Jr. announced the settlements as the jury trial was to begin yesterday .

 His original strategy ( in itself a <unk> innovation for spreading a <unk> ) was to create new economic enterprises each time he wanted to extend and fund his various <unk> <unk> . 
 <unk> airport and <unk> <unk> were intended only to provide start-up funds . 
 More stable industries were to build an economically viable infrastructure for the Moon movement in North America , as they had in Japan and South Korea . 
 Then he would move his movement to Europe . 
 But that was not to be . 
 <unk> the N and early N spokesmen for both the <unk> Church and its opponents in the <unk> movement gave wildly <unk> membership figures . 
 Their legacy lives on . 
 It is still common to read in the press that the church has N or more full-time American members and N `` associates . '' 
 Some estimates have gone as high as N members . 
 But internal church documents clearly show that at its <unk> <unk> , as when it organized a spectacular <unk> Stadium <unk> rally in N , there actually were only about N full-time <unk> Church members in the U.S. 
 Mr. Moon 's support for a <unk> Richard Nixon , the <unk> scandal , and his prison sentence for income-tax evasion did not help the church 's <unk> efforts . 
 <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> `` <unk> '' kept member turnover high . 
 That the membership number has even kept close to its N size is the result of the `` <unk> '' of the church . 
 Many of the enthusiastic young `` <unk> '' of the Nixon era who remained <unk> to <unk> Moon are now parents , producing new members by <unk> rather than conversion . 
 The <unk> wealth of the <unk> Church is another matter of contention . 
 For a while in the N it seemed Mr. Moon was on a spending spree , with such purchases as the former New <unk> Hotel and its adjacent Manhattan Center ; a fishing / processing conglomerate with branches in Alaska , Massachusetts , Virginia and Louisiana ; a former Christian Brothers <unk> and the Seagram family <unk> ( both <unk> <unk> on the Hudson River ) ; shares in banks from Washington to <unk> ; a motion picture production company , and newspapers , such as the Washington Times , the New York City Tribune ( originally the News World ) , and the successful <unk> <unk> del <unk> . 
 Yet these purchases can be misleading . 
 Most were obtained with huge <unk> of church money from South Korea and Japan , minimum cash <unk> and sizable mortgages . 
 Those teams of young <unk> selling flowers , <unk> or <unk> outright at traffic <unk> brought in somewhere near $ N million a year during the <unk> N , but those revenues were a <unk> compared to the costs of Mr. Moon 's <unk> international conferences , speaking <unk> , and <unk> land buys . 
 Only his factories in Japan and Korea , <unk> his <unk> at <unk> wages and producing everything from <unk> to <unk> to expensive marble <unk> , kept the money flowing <unk> . 
 Virginia Commonwealth University <unk> David <unk> , who more than any other researcher has <unk> into the complex world of <unk> finances , has concluded that profitable operations in the U.S. have been the exceptions rather than the rule . 
 <unk> , journalists John Burgess and Michael <unk> of the Washington Post have estimated that at least $ N million was transferred from Japan to the U.S. to deal with the church 's annual operating losses in this country . 
 Mr. Moon 's two <unk> U.S. newspapers illustrate the scope of this financial drain . 
 <unk> costs for the Washington Times alone were close to $ N million , and the total amount lost in this <unk> black hole was estimated at $ N million by N . 
 Since then , Moon 's organization has <unk> a pair of high-quality <unk> opinion magazines , The World and I and <unk> , which are a further drain . 
 <unk> say that not even their editors know for sure how much these <unk> publications , along with the newspapers , have cost Mr. Moon . 
 Many American <unk> businesses , such as a $ N million factory to build fishing vessels , are defunct . 
 Some components of the American church had their budgets cut in half last year and again this year . 
 The relatively small academic conferences that have attracted conservative guests -- and press scrutiny -- in recent years are much more narrowly targeted and <unk> than the <unk> <unk> in fancy <unk> and exotic <unk> of years past . 
 I attended several of these in the dual role as a <unk> of research findings as well as an investigator of my hosts . 
 ( Mr. Moon 's <unk> House eventually even published three of my <unk> books on <unk> and politics . ) 
 According to veteran watchers of <unk> affairs , such as Dr. J. Gordon <unk> , director of the Institute for the <unk> of American <unk> , almost all operations are being drastically reduced as Mr. Moon now <unk> more on developing his empire in the Far East . 
 `` Everything , '' one <unk> <unk> '' senior consultant to the <unk> Church recently told me in an interview , `` is going back to Korea and Japan . '' 
 ( Europe had proved even less <unk> than North America . 
 European politicians were less reluctant to have their governments investigate and <unk> new <unk> . ) 
 So Mr. Moon is in retreat , <unk> on the Far East . 
 South Korea and Japan continue to be profitable . 
 Moon 's <unk> industry conglomerate is now investing heavily in China , where church accountants have high hopes of expanding and attracting <unk> even in the wake of the bloody massacre in <unk> Square . 
 <unk> Motors is one such investment . 
 According to senior consultants to the church , Mr. Moon has successfully negotiated a joint venture with the Chinese government to build an <unk> plant in <unk> <unk> , an area of China with a substantial Korean minority . 
 Mr. Moon has agreed to put up $ N million a year for N years and keep the profits in China . 
 In return , he has the government 's blessing to build <unk> and spread <unk> in that country . 
 Whatever <unk> and ties to intellectuals and <unk> the publications and conferences bring really are salvage -- not the Rev. Moon 's original final goals , but the ones for which he will have to settle . 
 Mr. <unk> is <unk> ( with David G. <unk> ) of `` ` <unk> ' in America : <unk> , Church , and <unk> '' and `` <unk> <unk> : The Great American <unk> <unk> . 
 The Manville Personal <unk> <unk> Trust said it is considering several ways to ease a liquidity crunch that could include the sale of Manville Corp. to a third party . 
 In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission , the majority holder of Manville acknowledged that the cash portion of its initial funding of $ N million will be <unk> next year , and that alternative sources of funds will be necessary to meet its obligations . 
 The trust , which was created as part of Manville 's bankruptcy-law reorganization to compensate victims of <unk> diseases , ultimately expects to receive $ N billion from Manville , but its cash flow from investments has so far lagged behind its payments to victims . 
 <unk> for both the trust and the company refused to comment on whether any talks with a possible <unk> of Manville had actually taken place . 
 The trust is considering a sale of its Manville holdings , but Manville has the right of first refusal on any sales of its stock held by the trust . 
 Manville , a forest and building products concern , has offered to pay the trust $ N million for a majority of Manville 's convertible preferred stock . 
 Manville and the trust are discussing the offer , but no decision has been made . 
 The filing also said the trust is considering a sale of Manville securities in the open market ; an extraordinary dividend on the common stock ; or a recapitalization of Manville .

 China 's parliament ousted two Hong Kong residents from a panel <unk> a new <unk> for the colony .

 However , a Canadian Embassy official in <unk> <unk> said that Canada was unlikely to sell the <unk> <unk> <unk> to Israel since Israel has n't signed the Nuclear <unk> Treaty . 
 Israel has been accused in the past of using <unk> to seek elements needed to develop nuclear weapons . 
 The South Korean government is signing a <unk> today establishing formal diplomatic relations with Poland . 
 The two are also signing a trade agreement . 
 South Korean government officials said they do n't expect that Seoul can loan money to Warsaw , but it can `` offer experience . '' 
 Poland is the second Communist nation to recognize the Seoul government ; South Korea established diplomatic relations with Hungary in February N . 
 Venezuela will hold a <unk> auction Friday , with N potential bidders participating .

 Britain 's House of Commons passed a law that will force English <unk> fans to carry identity cards to enter <unk> . 
 The `` <unk> '' law , which would <unk> <unk> of cards , must be ratified by the House of <unk> and is expected to become effective early next year . 
 A federal judge ruled that <unk> Marcos was n't brought to the U.S. against her will and that <unk> <unk> , which protect spouses from <unk> each other , do n't apply in her case . 
 As a result , Judge John F. Keenan of New York ordered Mrs. Marcos to turn over to the court all <unk> and documents she may have filed in foreign countries in opposition to U.S. requests for evidence . 
 Mrs. Marcos had claimed that she did n't have to turn over the documents because she was brought here <unk> and because providing the materials would violate her <unk> privilege . 
 In N , a year and a half after Mrs. Marcos and her late husband , <unk> Marcos , the ousted president of the Philippines , fled the Philippines for Hawaii , they were charged with racketeering , conspiracy , <unk> of justice and mail fraud in a scheme in which they allegedly <unk> more than $ N million from their <unk> . 
 Much of the money was <unk> <unk> through purchases of prime Manhattan real estate , federal prosecutors have charged . 
 Mrs. Marcos 's trial is expected to begin in March . 
 U.S. law requires criminal defendants to turn over foreign documents such as those sought in the Marcos case . 
 The law is meant to overcome delays caused by defendants ' use of foreign procedures to block U.S. requests for records , Judge Keenan said in his opinion . 
 For instance , the documents could involve foreign business dealings or bank accounts . 
 The U.S. has charged that the <unk> ' alleged crimes involved bank accounts in the Philippines , Hong Kong , the U.S. and other countries . 
 On the <unk> of <unk> , Judge Keenan wrote , `` The suggestion that Mrs. Marcos was brought to this country against her will is <unk> by affidavit or <unk> . '' 
 The judge also said the two <unk> <unk> <unk> cited by Mrs. Marcos do n't apply . 
 The first one permits a witness to refuse to testify against her spouse . 
 But Judge Keenan said that privilege 's purpose is `` <unk> <unk> in marriage . '' 
 Because Mr. Marcos died Sept. N , the privilege can no longer apply , the judge said . 
 The second <unk> privilege cited by Mrs. Marcos protects <unk> communications between spouses . 
 But Judge Keenan said that privilege is meant to protect private <unk> -- not litigation papers filed with foreign governments , as Mrs. Marcos 's attorneys maintained . 
 Though Judge Keenan threw out most of Mrs. Marcos 's objections , he agreed with one of her concerns : that turning over the foreign documents could violate the defendant 's constitutional right against <unk> . 
 As a result , he said he will examine the Marcos documents sought by the prosecutors to determine whether turning over the filings is <unk> . 
 Judge Keenan also directed the prosecutors to show that Mrs. Marcos 's Fifth Amendment right against <unk> wo n't be violated . 
 Mrs. Marcos 's attorney in New York , <unk> <unk> , declined to comment on the ruling . 
 Mrs. Marcos has n't admitted that she filed any documents such as those sought by the government . 
 Charles <unk> , the assistant U.S. attorney <unk> the Marcos case , did n't return phone calls seeking comment .

 A Texas legislator proposes <unk> drivers ' licenses of some drug <unk> . 
 The bill would <unk> courts to order the licenses as a condition of <unk> . 
 State Senator <unk> `` <unk> '' Brown , a Republican who is running for Texas attorney general , introduced the bill . 
 He said an altered license would be an `` embarrassment '' to <unk> and young adults and would act as a <unk> to drug use . 
 Richard <unk> , executive director of the Texas Civil <unk> Union , called the proposal `` political <unk> , '' and said it fails to recognize the drug problem as a health issue . 
 The amendment , offered by Rep. Douglas <unk> ( D. , Calif. ) , was approved N during debate on a bill designed to strengthen the Transportation Department 's authority in dealing with leveraged buy-outs of airlines . 
 The bill would require the agency to block the acquisition of N % or more of an airline 's stock if the purchase threatened safety , reduced the carrier 's ability to compete , or put the airline under foreign control . 
 <unk> on the legislation , which faces a veto threat from President Bush , is to continue today . 
 The amendment would require the department to block the purchase of a major airline by anyone who has run two or more carriers that have filed for protection from creditors under Chapter N of the Bankruptcy Code . 
 In N , Texas Air 's Continental Airlines filed for bankruptcy . 
 Earlier this year , Texas Air 's Eastern Airlines filed for bankruptcy . 
 `` This ought to be <unk> the ` Do n't let Frank Lorenzo take over another airline ' amendment , '' said Rep. James <unk> ( D. , Minn. ) , chairman of the House aviation subcommittee , who argued that the provision was unnecessary because the bill already would give the department ample power to block <unk> deals . 
 For years , a strict <unk> <unk> the staff meetings at Nissan Motor Co. 's technical center in Tokyo 's western <unk> . 
 Employees wore <unk> <unk> listing not only their names but also their dates of hire . 
 No one could voice an opinion until everybody with more seniority had spoken first , so younger employees -- often the most enthusiastic and innovative -- seldom spoke up at all . 
 But in N , the <unk> and the `` do n't speak out of turn '' rule were <unk> -- early steps in a cultural revolution still rolling on with all the <unk> of a freight train . 
 In recent years , Nissan has instituted <unk> work schedules and allowed employees to dress <unk> , even in blue jeans . 
 A rule <unk> staffers to own competitors ' cars has been lifted , and now many <unk> drive foreign cars to get useful ideas . 
 Nissan 's <unk> corporate song filled with <unk> to <unk> Fuji has been scrapped in favor of a <unk> tune <unk> by a popular Japanese <unk> . 
 And in a Japanese corporate first , Nissan recently opened the first <unk> company <unk> for single employees at the suburban Tokyo technical center . 
 `` We had lots of internal debate about this one , '' concedes <unk> <unk> , a senior public-relations official . 
 `` But in the end , top management decided to follow the voice of the younger generation . '' 
 This corporate glasnost is a big reason Nissan , after years of making lackluster cars and <unk> profits , has <unk> up its rigid ways and now is riding a string of hits , ranging from the <unk> <unk> sedan and <unk> N to the <unk> <unk> <unk> , a <unk> sold only in Japan . 
 The company 's turnaround is far from complete ; many crucial tests are just beginning . 
 But its surprising progress so far holds important lessons for companies in trouble . 
 The big one : A company 's culture ca n't be <unk> changed unless top management first admits that things have gone badly <unk> and then publicly leads the charge . 
 <unk> <unk> , Nissan 's executive vice president for finance , helped set the tone in December N , when the company was heading toward the first operating loss by a Japanese auto maker since the nation 's postwar recovery . 
 `` This is a time of <unk> to discover what is wrong with us , '' he said . 
 <unk> Kume , who took the <unk> as Nissan 's president in June N , added simply , `` I am deeply disappointed . '' 
 No wonder . 
 Nissan , Japan 's second-largest auto maker and the world 's <unk> , was getting beat up not only by its bigger rival , Toyota Motor Corp. , but also by Honda Motor Co. , the most successful Japanese car company in the U.S. but a relative <unk> in Japan . 
 Nissan 's market share in Japan had been dropping year by year since the beginning of the decade . 
 Its U.S. sales <unk> , partly because of price increases due to the rising yen . 
 <unk> of all , Nissan was <unk> with management <unk> , <unk> and corporate <unk> . 
 Consider the experience of <unk> <unk> , a N designer of vehicle <unk> who joined Nissan in N . 
 At that time , tasks were assigned strictly on the basis of seniority . 
 `` The <unk> designer got to work on the <unk> , '' she recalls . 
 `` The next level down did doors . 
 If a new person got to work on part of the <unk> , that was a big deal . '' 
 This system produced boring , <unk> cars that consumers just were n't buying . 
 <unk> hoping to spark sales , Nissan transferred N middle managers and plant workers to dealerships . 
 Meanwhile , President Kume ordered everyone from top executives to <unk> <unk> to go `` town watching , '' to visit <unk> parts of Tokyo to try to gain <unk> into developing cars for <unk> . 
 Some <unk> <unk> were downright comic . 
 One group of <unk> manufacturing men from the company 's <unk> plant outside Tokyo was supposed to check out a <unk> restaurant in the city . 
 But when they arrived at the door , all were afraid to go in , <unk> that they would be out of place . 
 Other trips were more productive . 
 Mr. Kume himself visited Honda 's headquarters in Tokyo 's upscale <unk> district . 
 He liked the <unk> lobby display of Honda 's cars and trucks so much that he had Nissan 's gloomy lobby exhibit <unk> . 
 Later , Nissan borrowed other Honda practices , including an engineering `` idea contest '' to promote <unk> . 
 One engineer developed a `` <unk> car '' that moves <unk> . 
 Such sudden cultural shifts may come across as a bit forced , but they seem to be genuine -- so much so , in fact , that some older employees have resisted . 
 Nissan handled the <unk> in a typically Japanese fashion : They were n't fired but instead `` were neglected , '' says <unk> <unk> , the personnel manager at the Nissan Technical Center . 
 Despite the pain of adjusting , the cultural revolution has begun to yield exciting cars . 
 A year ago , the company completely revamped its <unk> sedan , the $ N <unk> , which <unk> against a broad range of upscale <unk> ; it replaced its <unk> , <unk> body with <unk> , <unk> lines . 
 Since then , Nissan also has launched new versions of the $ N N <unk> <unk> and N sports car . 
 The <unk> N costs as much as $ N and is <unk> off against the <unk> N , which begins at $ N . 
 Besides new <unk> , the new <unk> have more powerful engines and more sophisticated suspension systems . 
 All three new models are <unk> their <unk> by wide margins . 
 In its home market , Nissan has grabbed attention with <unk> <unk> featuring <unk> odd enough to be <unk> . 
 One is the <unk> , a tiny <unk> with a <unk> <unk> top and <unk> <unk> that give it a <unk> look . 
 Nissan initially planned to sell just N <unk> , but sales have passed N , and there 's a one-year waiting list for the car . 
 Then , there 's the <unk> , an <unk> delivery van with a <unk> body that inspired its name . 
 Nissan helped develop a Tokyo restaurant with both vehicles as its design theme . 
 The chairs are <unk> seats , and a gift shop sells such items as alarm <unk> <unk> like the <unk> 's <unk> <unk> . 
 All these vehicles have sharply improved Nissan 's morale and image -- but have n't done much for its market share . 
 Nissan had N % of the Japanese car market in N before beginning a <unk> <unk> slide that continued through last year . 
 Strong sales so far this year are certain to turn the <unk> , but even the N % market share that Nissan expects in N will leave it far below its position at the beginning of the decade . 
 Nissan concedes that it wo n't <unk> all its <unk> losses in Japan until at least N , and even that timetable might prove optimistic . 
 `` Everyone else is going to catch up '' with Nissan 's innovative designs , says A. <unk> <unk> , auto analyst at First Boston ( Japan ) Ltd . 
 Nissan 's pace of <unk> hits will slow , he adds , just as <unk> Toyota <unk> its own batch of new cars . 
 <unk> , in the U.S. , Nissan has grabbed N % of the car market so far this year , up from N % a year ago . 
 But even that brings Nissan only to the share it had in N , and leaves the company behind its high of N % in N and N . 
 Why ? 
 So far , Nissan 's <unk> successes are mostly <unk> vehicles with limited sales potential . 
 In compact and <unk> cars , the bread-and-butter sales <unk> for Japanese auto makers , Nissan still trails Toyota and Honda . 
 Nissan hopes that that will start to change this fall , with its new version of the <unk> compact sedan . 
 The <unk> has been a <unk> compared with Honda 's <unk> successful <unk> and Toyota 's <unk> . 
 But this year , Honda has revamped the <unk> and made it a midsized car . 
 Nissan instead has kept its new <unk> a bit smaller than that and cut the base price N % ; at $ N , <unk> prices start $ N below the predecessor model yet have a <unk> engine . 
 <unk> prices start at $ N . 
 Nissan 's risk is that its <unk> strategy might get lost amid the highly publicized rebates being offered by Detroit 's Big Three . 
 But `` on a new car , a <unk> does n't work well '' because it <unk> the vehicle 's image , contends Thomas D. <unk> , executive vice president of Nissan 's U.S. sales arm . 
 Even if the new <unk> succeeds , Nissan will remain behind in the <unk> segment , where its <unk> does n't measure up to the Honda <unk> and Toyota <unk> . 
 Nissan will introduce a completely revamped <unk> next fall . 
 At the opposite end of the market , Nissan <unk> its luxury Infiniti division on Nov. N -- three years after Honda <unk> Japanese luxury cars and two months after Toyota 's Lexus went on sale . 
 Nissan started advertising Infiniti fully eight months before the cars hit American <unk> . 
 The ads featured <unk> , rocks and <unk> <unk> -- almost anything but the cars themselves . 
 The ads have generated some <unk> but also plenty of attention because they are so unlike any other U.S. auto advertising . 
 On the other hand , Nissan 's sales goals for Infiniti are modest compared with Toyota 's targets for Lexus . 
 Nissan will build only about N of the $ N Infiniti N <unk> each month , sending about N of them to the U.S. and keeping the rest for sale in Japan . 
 Toyota wants to sell about N Lexus N <unk> next year in the U.S. alone . 
 `` When I saw the Lexus sales projections , I got worried , '' <unk> <unk> <unk> , who led the Infiniti development team . 
 But on reflection , Mr. <unk> says , he concluded that Nissan is being prudent in following its <unk> strategy instead of simply copying Lexus . 
 `` Infiniti is Nissan 's big business move for the N century , and we 're in no hurry to generate large profits right away , '' Mr. <unk> says . 
 Despite plans to add two new Infiniti models next year , bringing the total to four , Infiniti wo n't show profits for at least five years , he adds . 
 These days Nissan can afford that strategy , even though profits are n't exactly robust . 
 Nissan had record net income of N billion yen ( $ N million ) in the fiscal year ended last March N , a remarkable recovery from the N billion yen of two years earlier , when the company lost money on operations . 
 Nissan has increased earnings more than market share by cutting costs and by taking advantage of a general surge in Japanese car sales . 
 But Nissan expects to earn only N billion yen in the current fiscal year , a modest increase of N % . 
 The big reason : For all its cost-cutting , Nissan remains less efficient than Toyota . 
 In its last fiscal year , Nissan 's profit represented just N % of sales , compared with N % at Toyota . 
 To help close the gap , Nissan recently established a <unk> cost-cutting committee . 
 Nissan is the world 's only auto maker currently building vehicles in all three of the world 's key economic <unk> -- the U.S. , Japan and Europe . 
 That gives it an <unk> strategic advantage , at least until its rivals catch up , but also plenty of <unk> <unk> . 
 For example , Nissan 's U.S. operations include N separate subsidiaries -- for manufacturing , sales , design , research , <unk> -- that report separately back to Japan . 
 And in July , Nissan 's Tennessee manufacturing plant beat back a United Auto Workers organizing effort with aggressive tactics that have left some workers bitter . 
 `` We are in a <unk> phase from being a Japanese company to becoming an international company based in Japan , '' says Mr. <unk> , the executive vice president . 
 He promises that Nissan will soon establish a holding company overseeing all U.S. operations , just as it 's doing in Europe . 
 Perhaps the biggest challenge , however , will be to prevent a return to its former corporate <unk> as its recovery continues . 
 Already , personnel officials are talking about the need for a `` <unk> Two '' <unk> effort of some sort . 
 `` We are still only half way through the turnaround of this company , and there are many more things to do , '' President Kume says . 
 He adds , however , that `` the momentum we have generated is <unk> . 
 As expected , Warner Bros . Records said it agreed to form a <unk> and <unk> joint venture with former MCA Records Chairman Irving Azoff . 
 Warner said it will provide financing for the venture , but did n't disclose terms . 
 Mr. Azoff has n't named the company yet , but any records it produces will be distributed by Warner . 
 Warner is part of Warner Communications Inc. , which is in the process of being acquired by Time Warner Inc . 
 Mr. Azoff resigned as head of MCA Records , a unit of MCA Inc. , in September , and had been discussing a joint venture with both Warner and MCA . 
 In a statement yesterday , Mr. Azoff said he chose Warner , the largest record company , because `` their standing in the entertainment industry is second to none . 
 President Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev will hold an informal meeting in early December , a move that should give both leaders a political boost at home . 
 The White House is <unk> not calling the meeting a summit so that there wo n't be any expectation of detailed negotiations or agreements . 
 Rather , senior administration officials said that the unexpected meeting was scheduled at Mr. Bush 's request because of his preference for conducting <unk> through highly personal and informal meetings with other leaders . 
 The two leaders will meet on Dec. N and N , <unk> the two days of meetings between a U.S. and a Soviet naval <unk> in the <unk> Sea . 
 The unusual <unk> meeting wo n't disrupt plans for a formal summit meeting next spring or summer , at which an arms-control treaty is likely to be completed . 
 In announcing the meeting yesterday , Mr. Bush told reporters at the White House that neither he nor Mr. Gorbachev expects any `` substantial decisions or agreements . '' 
 Instead , he said that the purpose is simply for the two to get `` better <unk> '' and discuss a wide range of issues without a formal agenda . 
 Despite the informal nature of the session and the calculated effort to hold down expectations , the meeting could pay significant political dividends for both leaders . 
 Mr. Gorbachev badly needs a <unk> from the serious economic problems and ethnic unrest he faces at home . 
 American officials have said that a meeting with the leader of the U.S. could help bolster his <unk> among Soviet politicians and <unk> , whose support he needs . 
 For his part , Mr. Bush has been criticized regularly at home for moving too slowly and cautiously in reacting to Mr. Gorbachev 's reforms and the historic moves away from <unk> in Eastern Europe . 
 A face-to-face meeting with Mr. Gorbachev should damp such criticism , though it will hardly eliminate it . 
 Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell ( D. , Maine ) , who has been the most prominent Democratic critic of Mr. Bush 's handling of the Soviet relationship , praised the president for arranging the meeting . 
 But he added : `` The mere fact of a meeting does n't deal with the substance of policy . '' 
 Mr. Bush said that the December meeting , which was announced simultaneously in Moscow , will be held in the unusual setting of ships at sea to hold down the `` <unk> '' and force the two sides to limit participation to just small groups of advisers . 
 `` By doing it in this manner we can have , I would say , more time without the press of social activities or mandatory joint <unk> , things of that nature for public consumption , '' Mr. Bush said . 
 Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze , at a news conference in Moscow , said , `` As the two sides plan to hold a <unk> summit in late <unk> summer next year , they found it useful , I would say even necessary , to hold an interim informal meeting . '' 
 Although no specific agreements are expected , Mr. Shevardnadze said `` that does n't mean they will be without an agenda . '' 
 If the two leaders cover the subjects that have been featured in lower level U.S.-Soviet meetings , their talks would include human rights , Soviet reforms , regional disputes , relations with allies , economic cooperation , arms control , and joint efforts to fight <unk> , terrorism and pollution . 
 The president specifically mentioned U.S. economic advice to Moscow as a possible topic . 
 Mr. Gorbachev has for months been publicly urging the U.S. to drop its restrictions on Soviet trade . 
 He recently told a small group of American businessmen in Moscow that he hoped to sign a general trade agreement with the U.S. , possibly at the N summit . 
 The Soviets hope a trade agreement would give them <unk> <unk> status , which would lower the tariffs on Soviet exports to the U.S. . 
 In an unusually <unk> article about the latest economic <unk> -- unemployment -- Pravda yesterday reported that three million Soviets have lost their jobs as a result of perestroika and the number could grow to N million by the year N . 
 Economists in Moscow are now proposing that the state start a system of unemployment benefits . 
 But one Bush administration official <unk> about the summit plan cautioned against assuming that there will be bold new initiatives on the Soviet economy or other issues . 
 `` Do n't take this as some big opening for major movement on economic cooperation , or arms control , or the environment , '' he said . 
 `` Those things will all come up , but in a fairly informal way . '' 
 Instead , this official said , `` This is <unk> George Bush . 
 This was George Bush 's own idea . 
 It 's George Bush wanting to meet a foreign leader and talk to him directly . '' 
 Aside from the Soviet economic <unk> and talks on cutting strategic and chemical arms , one other issue the Soviets are likely to want to raise is naval force reductions . 
 Western analysts say that , given the meeting 's setting at sea , Gorbachev is unlikely to pass up the opportunity to press once again for negotiated cuts in the <unk> of both the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw <unk> . 
 That theme has been a <unk> one for Soviet military officials for much of this year . 
 They argue that as the Kremlin follows through on announced plans to cut land forces -- the Soviets ' area of greatest strength -- the U.S. should show more willingness to cut sea forces -- Washington 's area of greatest <unk> . 
 One of the reasons Bush administration aides are anxious to insist that the coming meeting will be informal is to avoid comparisons with the last such <unk> structured <unk> gathering , former President Reagan 's N meeting with Mr. Gorbachev in <unk> , <unk> . 
 That meeting sent <unk> through the Western alliance because Mr. Reagan was pulled into discussing the possible elimination of nuclear weapons without consulting American allies . 
 Mr. Bush said that he initiated talks with the Soviets on the informal meeting by sending a proposal to Mr. Gorbachev last July , which the Soviet leader readily accepted . 
 But word of the possible session was closely held by the president and a handful of top aides , and word of it did n't reach many <unk> officials until the past few days . 
 Indeed , many senior officials had been insisting for weeks that Mr. Bush was n't interested in such an informal <unk> . 
 Though President Bush 's political critics at home have been urging him to open a more direct dialogue with Mr. Gorbachev , it actually was the arguments of leaders within the Soviet bloc itself that led the president to seek the December meeting . 
 Mr. Bush decided he wanted the meeting after talking in Europe in July with the leaders of Poland and Hungary , who urged him to support Mr. Gorbachev 's efforts to transform the Soviet system and to urge him to loosen his grip on Eastern Europe , a senior aide said . 
 While flying home from those discussions , Mr. Bush drafted a letter to Mr. Gorbachev suggesting an informal <unk> to <unk> their formal summit next year . 
 Peter <unk> in Moscow contributed to this article . 
 <unk> <unk> del <unk> said its potential losses from lending to <unk> could reach N trillion lire ( $ N million ) , marking the bank 's first <unk> of potential costs of unauthorized lending by its Atlanta branch . 
 BNL previously reported that its Georgia branch had taken on loan commitments <unk> $ N billion without the <unk> management 's approval . 
 <unk> BNL , Italy 's largest bank , has filed charges against the branch 's former manager , Christopher <unk> , and a former branch vice president , alleging fraud and breach of their fiduciary duties . 
 BNL also said that its board had approved `` after an <unk> discussion , '' a letter to the Bank of Italy <unk> measures the state-owned bank has taken or plans to take to improve controls on its foreign branches . 
 The central bank had ordered BNL to come up with a suitable program by yesterday . 
 Bank of Italy has also ordered BNL to shore up its capital base to account for potential foreign loan losses , and the Rome bank has <unk> a N trillion lire <unk> operation . 
 BNL was unable to elaborate on what measures were planned by the bank to improve controls on its branches abroad . 
 <unk> a day <unk> without news photos of the police <unk> <unk> protesters from some building or <unk> in one of our cities . 
 Of recent note are the activities of the <unk> and <unk> , <unk> activists , animal rights protesters , college students concerned about <unk> , <unk> groups , various <unk> `` environmentalists '' and those <unk> with the pace of the war against AIDS . 
 Maybe he did n't start it , but <unk> Gandhi certainly provided a <unk> beginning to non-violent civil disobedience as we know it today . 
 The <unk> , or `` great <unk> one , '' <unk> several campaigns of passive resistance against the British government in India . 
 Unfortunately , according to Webster 's <unk> <unk> , `` His policies went beyond his control and resulted ... in <unk> and <unk> '' and later a renewed campaign of civil disobedience `` resulted in <unk> and a second <unk> . '' 
 I am not a <unk> of everything Gandhi did , but some of his law breaking was justified because India was then under <unk> by a foreign power , and Indians were not able to participate fully in decisions that <unk> affected them . 
 It is difficult , however , to justify civil disobedience , non-violent or not , where citizens have full <unk> to the ballot box to effect change . 
 Where truly representative governments are <unk> by constitutional <unk> of human rights and an independent judiciary to <unk> those rights , there is no excuse for breaking the law because some individual or group <unk> with it . 
 There may be a few cases where the law breaking is well <unk> and so completely <unk> of the rights of others that it is difficult to criticize it . 
 The case of <unk> Parks , the black woman who refused to sit at the back of the bus , comes to mind as an illustration . 
 But most cases of non-violent civil disobedience are not nearly so <unk> . 
 The public has a tendency to <unk> <unk> demonstrations with non-violent civil disobedience . 
 It is true that both are non-violent , but there is a fundamental difference between them . 
 <unk> demonstrations , such as peaceful <unk> and other <unk> that do not <unk> the peace or cause a public <unk> or interfere with the rights of others , are rights guaranteed by any truly free system of government . 
 Civil disobedience , violent or non-violent , is <unk> law breaking . 
 The subject of this discussion is non-violent civil disobedience ; but , before we get on with that , let me make just a few <unk> remarks about <unk> demonstrations . 
 They are useful to call public attention to <unk> , but they have little value in <unk> anyone about the issues in dispute . 
 The <unk> of television in dramatic confrontation <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> through <unk> , <unk> gestures , <unk> signs and other <unk> inspired tactics . 
 <unk> <unk> and an environment where compromise can begin are lost in a hostile <unk> <unk> by <unk> media interviews . 
 At best , demonstrations are <unk> and <unk> <unk> ; at worst , they can become the <unk> that lead to law breaking . 
 <unk> are particularly apt to <unk> into criminal conduct when they leave the site of the <unk> and become mobile . 
 <unk> criminals and street people looking for excitement attach themselves like <unk> to the <unk> of the crowd and use the protest as an excuse for rock throwing , auto <unk> , <unk> , window breaking , <unk> , <unk> picking and general <unk> . 
 Soon the whole purpose of the demonstration is lost in <unk> <unk> . 
 There are better ways to promote a cause . 
 Where non-violent civil disobedience is the centerpiece , rather than a <unk> demonstration that may only attract crime , it is difficult to justify . 
 Some find no harm in the <unk> of <unk> , minor property destruction , blocking traffic and the like . 
 They say these are small prices to pay for <unk> action for the <unk> cause . 
 The crimes may appear small , but the prices can be huge . 
 Here are two cases to illustrate . 
 <unk> a neighborhood demonstration to protest speeding on a certain road or a <unk> accident involving a police car . 
 The protesters lie down in the street , blocking traffic , and will not move until the authorities carry them away . 
 <unk> that someone caught in the <unk> has a heart attack . 
 There is no way to get an <unk> in quickly to move him to a hospital . 
 He <unk> . 
 The demonstration was non-violent and involved only a simple <unk> , but its impact on that individual was violent and terminal . 
 <unk> that a TV network is airing a <unk> interview program with a live audience . 
 The politician appearing is highly controversial and has recently generated a good deal of <unk> amid certain groups . 
 In a planned protest against his appearance , several members of the studio audience chain themselves in front of the TV cameras in such a way that the program can not continue . 
 The network must refund money to the advertisers and loses considerable revenue and <unk> . 
 The demonstrators have been non-violent , but the result of their <unk> has been to seriously <unk> the rights of others <unk> with their dispute . 
 It might be alleged that TV has done more than its share to <unk> and promote non-violent civil disobedience , so the second situation <unk> above would be simply a case of `` <unk> coming home to <unk> . '' 
 Or maybe the TV network would lose nothing . 
 <unk> or Phil would probably pull up another camera and interview the <unk> protesters . 
 Let us look for a moment at another type of non-violent civil disobedience that only <unk> other people indirectly , yet does <unk> damage to the nation as a whole . 
 I am referring to those young men who chose to <unk> their country 's call to arms during the Vietnam war and fled to Canada or some other <unk> to avoid combat . 
 Their <unk> acts of civil disobedience , which they tried to hide under the <unk> of <unk> at a war they characterized as `` <unk> , '' weakened the national fabric and threw additional burdens on those who served <unk> in that conflict . 
 Even more at fault are those leaders in and out of government who urged and supported their <unk> , thereby giving great help and comfort to the enemy <unk> . 
 It is amazing that the <unk> mass executions in Vietnam and Cambodia do not weight more heavily on minds so morally <unk> . 
 Worse , it remained to a <unk> but <unk> president of the United States to <unk> the final <unk> upon those who fought and died in Vietnam . 
 Under the <unk> of `` <unk> the <unk> of the nation , '' President Carter <unk> thousands of draft <unk> , thus giving dignity to their allegations of the war 's `` <unk> . '' 
 The precedent having been set , who can complain if future generations called upon to defend the U.S. yield to the <unk> to avoid the danger of combat by simply declaring the war <unk> and <unk> until it is over ? 
 Finally , I think it important to point out the <unk> high <unk> of non-violent civil disobedience in these days of intensive media coverage . 
 <unk> television a chance to cover live any breaking of the law , and no second invitation will be required . 
 This brings into question the <unk> of those who lead civil disobedience demonstrations . 
 Do they want the <unk> for themselves or for their cause ? 
 Here is a good rule of <unk> : If the movement produced the leader , the chance that he is <unk> is much greater than if the leader produced the movement . 
 In either case , ask yourself whether you have become better informed on the issues under protest by watching the act of civil disobedience . 
 If you have not , it is probable that a <unk> airing of the dispute by calm and rational debate would have been the better course . 
 Mr. <unk> was vice president of the U.S. from N until he resigned in N . 
 Gov. George Deukmejian and key legislators agreed to back a temporary <unk> increase in the state sales tax to raise $ N million for repairs and relief associated with last month 's earthquake . 
 The tax increase , which will be considered at a special session of the state legislature that begins tomorrow , would cover only part of the estimated $ N billion to $ N billion in total damage caused by the Oct. N quake . 
 Aside from as much as $ N billion in recently approved federal aid , the state is expected to draw from a <unk> emergency fund that currently stands at an estimated $ N million . 
 `` I am not aware that there is anything but bipartisan agreement for the general <unk> '' of the <unk> plan , said a spokesman for the governor , after a Monday meeting with legislative leaders over the <unk> question . 
 The tax increase -- on top of the current <unk> per dollar sales tax -- would become effective this Dec. N and expire Dec. N , N . 
 The <unk> plan was preferred over an alternative that would have boosted the state gasoline tax . 
 Some legislators expressed concern that a <unk> increase would take too long and possibly damage chances of a major <unk> ballot initiative that voters will consider next June . 
 Despite continuing problems in its newsprint business , <unk> Corp. posted a N % gain in third-quarter net income . 
 The consumer-products and newsprint company said net rose to $ N million , or $ N a share , from $ N million , or $ N a share , a year ago . 
 Sales rose N % to $ N billion from $ N billion . 
 After a flat second quarter tied largely to lower newsprint earnings , <unk> attributed the gain to improved results in its consumer businesses in North America , Brazil and Korea . 
 Those gains came from higher prices , particularly for disposable <unk> and tissue products , and from increased sales , primarily for <unk> products , the company said . 
 <unk> results continued to be depressed , the company added , because of industrywide price discounting . 
 The <unk> comparison was also enhanced by charges taken in the year-earlier period , including $ N million related to the <unk> of a pulp and newsprint mill in <unk> . 
 In the N period also , interest expense and tax rates were lower than a year ago . 
 In the first nine months , profit rose N % to $ N million , or $ N a share , from $ N million , or $ N a share . 
 Sales rose N % to $ N billion from $ N billion . 
 In New York Stock Exchange composite trading , <unk> closed at $ N a share , up $ N . 
 <unk> <unk> are coming to N taxpayers as research <unk> pigs . 
 This is the year : <unk> <unk> of N personal returns are being picked <unk> for <unk> audits to help the IRS <unk> its criteria for enforcement , audit selection , and use of resources . 
 The last <unk> <unk> <unk> Program survey covered N returns . 
 The N project starts Jan. N and is to be done by May N , N . 
 <unk> trained IRS agents will look for <unk> income and <unk> deductions and credits . 
 The agents will make more than routine inquiries about such items as <unk> status and <unk> ; they want to look at living standards and business assets . 
 But they also are to see that taxpayers get all <unk> tax benefits and to ask if <unk> who sought IRS aid were satisfied with it . 
 <unk> have ruled that taxpayers must submit to <unk> audits , but the IRS will excuse from the <unk> <unk> anyone who was <unk> without change for either N or N . 
 <unk> have been suggested -- but never adopted -- for <unk> who come through <unk> audits without change . 
 <unk> <unk> is still likely , congressional sources say . 
 <unk> proposals to <unk> the more than N civil penalties and make them <unk> and easier to <unk> are in the House tax bill . 
 But they were stripped from the Senate bill after staffers estimated penalty revenue would fall by $ N million over five years . 
 Still , congressional aides say penalty reform is a strong candidate for enactment , even if not this time around , although some provisions may be <unk> . 
 Sen. <unk> ( D. , <unk> ) , a leader on the issue who generally backs the House plan , wants some changes -- for one , separate sanctions for <unk> and large <unk> of tax owed , not a single penalty . 
 He would ease the proposed penalties for delayed <unk> deposits and for <unk> <unk> N and other reports that taxpayers correct voluntarily . 
 The General Accounting Office urges Congress to ensure that all penalties retain their force as <unk> . 
 <unk> ' <unk> are defined by a growing number of states . 
 The N tax act created a federal bill of rights <unk> out IRS duties to protect taxpayers ' rights in the assessment and collection of taxes . 
 States are following suit . 
 California enacted a rights law in N . 
 In N , Illinois , Kansas , Ohio , Oregon and South Carolina have adopted rights laws , the Federation of Tax <unk> , a state officials ' group , reports ; the features vary . 
 And taxpayer groups are urging legislation in many other states . 
 One group is the Committee on State <unk> , which <unk> N <unk> corporations and advises the Council of State Chambers of Commerce . 
 The group 's Mark <unk> says its efforts begun in N have led to the introduction of bills in Massachusetts , Minnesota and Colorado to establish <unk> procedures affecting all kinds of taxpayers . 
 The group also seeks <unk> among states in provisions for taxpayers ' rights . 
 This week , New York City announced a N policy <unk> on the federal bill of rights for taxpayers . 
 THE <unk> RATE allowed for business use of a car in N has risen to N cents a <unk> for the first N from N cents in N , the IRS says ; the rate stays N cents for each added <unk> . 
 Also <unk> : N cents for charitable activities and nine cents for medical and moving costs . 
 IRA <unk> could be used to qualify for bank services under a bill entered by <unk> Chandler ( R. , Wash . ) and <unk> ( D. , Texas ) .

 <unk> <unk> vast <unk> .

 <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , but he could n't milk it , the Tax Court says . 
 The court often weighs deductions of <unk> costs : Do they stem from a <unk> activity or a <unk> <unk> ? 
 But it 's rare to see both functions in one case . 
 Charles O. <unk> of <unk> <unk> , Ind. - investment broker , <unk> , and son of a former stable owner - <unk> Tennessee <unk> <unk> for six years , raised cattle for four , and never made a profit on either . 
 He claimed losses totaling $ N -- and the IRS denied them all . 
 <unk> Judge <unk> noted that <unk> managed <unk> in a <unk> way : He kept detailed accounts , practiced soil conservation , enhanced his experience by consulting experts , spent several hours a day doing chores , and dropped the <unk> when his best <unk> <unk> died . 
 Yet he took little <unk> care with his cattle : He had no prior experience and did n't seek business counsel about them . 
 The judge said <unk> may <unk> his $ N of losses from horse breeding , but rejected the $ N in deductions from the cattle operation .

 The U.S. and Finland signed an income-tax treaty , subject to <unk> . 
 An arbitrator awarded Eastern Airlines pilots between $ N million and $ N million in back pay , a decision that could <unk> the carrier 's bankruptcy-law reorganization . 
 Eastern , a unit of Texas Air Corp. , said it is <unk> the ruling to determine if it can appeal . 
 It 's unclear whether Eastern will succeed in <unk> the arbitrator 's decision , made in a <unk> `` pay parity '' dispute that <unk> both the carrier 's Chapter N petition and its N acquisition by Texas Air . 
 All Eastern 's previous court efforts to head off the pilots ' demands have failed . 
 An Eastern spokesman said he does n't expect that the arbitrator 's ruling `` will have any overall material effect on the company 's strategic plan . '' 
 Bankruptcy experts said the law is n't clear on how such an arbitration ruling can affect a company 's case . 
 Like any other creditor , the pilots will have to apply to the court for payment of their claim . 
 That may leave a lot of <unk> for U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. <unk> to decide what , if anything , the pilots actually collect . 
 In August , he issued the ruling that let the pilots pursue their <unk> <unk> before the arbitrator . 
 The pilots ' contract with Eastern calls for a <unk> acceptable private arbitrator to resolve such <unk> . 
 In a statement to employees , Eastern said the company was disappointed by the ruling . 
 `` The obligation is totally unwarranted , '' the statement said . 
 James <unk> , a lawyer for the Air Line <unk> Association , said the pilots were extremely pleased . 
 `` This is a blow not only to Eastern but to the creditors committee , '' he said . 
 Eastern 's creditors committee , along with the company , has consistently opposed the pilots ' claim , which if paid would have to come out of money both hope to use to pay off other bankruptcy claims . 
 Eastern and its creditors are in the final , delicate stages of negotiating a second reorganization plan to pay off the airline 's debts . 
 An earlier plan , which had received the creditors ' approval in July , fell apart when Eastern changed its business plan . 
 It is n't known whether the pilot claim was figured into either plan . 
 The dispute between Eastern and its pilots is over a `` pay parity '' clause in the pilots ' contract . 
 The clause was part of an agreement in which pilots accepted a substantial pay cut as long as no other labor group got a raise . 
 Shortly after Texas Air took control of Eastern , some Machinists union supervisors received a N % pay raise . 
 The pilots argued that this triggered a pay raise for them . 
 Eastern has disputed the claim , but a federal district court , an appeals court and now the arbitrator have all <unk> with the pilots . 
 The two sides do n't even agree about how much money is at issue . 
 The pilots put the amount as high as $ N million , the company at $ N million . 
 Another arbitrator is hearing another pay parity case between Eastern and its pilots , resulting from a similar set of circumstances involving a separate pay raise granted another union . 
 A decision on that case is n't expected before <unk> . 
 Ironically , many of the pilots involved have left Eastern or are still striking the carrier , which filed for bankruptcy protection March N . 
 About N have crossed the <unk> lines and returned to work . 
 Few people in the advertising business have raised as many <unk> as <unk> A. Achenbaum . 
 The general public may not know his name , but he 's famous -- make that <unk> -- in advertising circles : A marketing consultant , he <unk> slashing ad agency commissions , to the <unk> of advertising clients and the <unk> of agencies . 
 Now , after beating them , Mr. Achenbaum is joining them . 
 Backer Spielvogel Bates Worldwide named Mr. Achenbaum , N , vice chairman of professional services , reporting directly to Carl Spielvogel , chairman and chief executive officer . 
 He joins Nov. N , <unk> his consulting firm , <unk> , Achenbaum Associates . 
 In years past , the ad industry 's most <unk> executives did n't hesitate to <unk> Mr. Achenbaum . 
 They have since <unk> , although one senior Young & Rubicam executive , <unk> others , said : `` I think ad agencies owe Carl { Spielvogel } a vote of thanks for getting him out of the consulting business . '' 
 But industry executives also believe hiring Mr. Achenbaum is a <unk> move for Backer Spielvogel , a unit of Saatchi & Saatchi . 
 Mr. Achenbaum has counted among his clients some of the most visible blue-chip advertisers in the country , including Nissan , Toyota , Seagram and Backer Spielvogel clients Hyundai and J.P. Morgan . 
 At Backer Spielvogel , he will work with clients and potential clients on marketing strategies ; aside from agency compensation issues , he helped Nissan , for example , come up with its <unk> and pricing for its new Infiniti line . 
 His client contacts , meanwhile , could prove a gold mine for an agency that has had few new business wins of late . 
 `` I 've done over N ad agency searches { for clients } , so I have a pretty good notion of what clients are interested in when they look for an agency , '' Mr. Achenbaum said . 
 As a consultant , he has given <unk> at agencies including Ogilvy & Mather on how to win new business . 
 Mr. Spielvogel said he hopes Mr. Achenbaum will do some strategic consulting at the agency for `` <unk> , in hopes that they become clients . '' 
 At Backer Spielvogel , Mr. Spielvogel 's <unk> has been personal involvement with all major clients . 
 He <unk> them ; he <unk> them to <unk> parties ; he <unk> them . 
 Mr. Achenbaum , too , <unk> into his clients ' business . 
 `` Carl has a much higher degree of <unk> with his clients than is ordinary for an agency his size . 
 And with Al 's record of being a <unk> and a detail guy , you can see how the two fit , '' said Alan <unk> , an analyst with PaineWebber . 
 Mr. Achenbaum 's move follows the announcement last month that his consulting partner , Stanley <unk> , N , would retire . 
 When the announcement came out , `` I picked up the phone and said , ` Why do n't you come to us ? ' '' Mr. Spielvogel said . 
 Mr. Achenbaum , who had been considering <unk> down his firm or <unk> it with another small consulting <unk> , soon agreed . 
 The two men are longtime friends and tennis partners , having met about N years ago . 
 Before becoming a consultant in N , Mr. Achenbaum was a senior executive at J. Walter Thompson Co . 
 He spent most of his career <unk> marketing strategies , but became <unk> for <unk> away at ad agency compensation . 
 Ad agencies typically earned a straight N % commission ; if a client spent $ N million on TV time , the agency made $ N million . 
 But Mr. Achenbaum <unk> negotiated fees , which often worked out to less than N % . 
 More recently , he negotiated `` <unk> '' <unk> in which an ad agency in some cases must pay a client if it drops the account . 
 He ultimately became so well-known for cutting compensation , however , that clients did n't seek him out for anything else . 
 `` I was very frustrated , '' he said . 
 `` The fact of the matter is , I am a marketer . 
 That 's another reason { for the Backer Spielvogel job } . 
 It struck me as a way to get back to what I really want to do . '' 
 Mr. Spielvogel added <unk> : `` The pressure on commissions did n't begin with Al Achenbaum . '' 
 Mr. Spielvogel said Mr. Achenbaum will work with clients to determine the mix of promotion , <unk> , publicity and other marketing outlets , and to integrate those services . 
 He will concentrate on , among others , J.P. Morgan and Hyundai . 
 Mr. Achenbaum helped Morgan in its recent agency search , and he has a long relationship with Hyundai , which is having severe troubles , including declining sales . 
 `` The trail of revenue is increasingly going away from pure advertising , and going <unk> other services , '' Mr. Spielvogel said . 
 Instead of being just an ad agency , he said : `` We have <unk> our mission here . 
 Our mission is to help our clients grow , and to use every tool of marketing communications to accomplish that . '' 
 Industry executives are <unk> Mr. Achenbaum well . 
 Leonard <unk> , <unk> of the American Association of Advertising <unk> , called Mr. Achenbaum a `` <unk> '' in an <unk> N speech . 
 Yesterday , Mr. <unk> , now a consultant with the Stamford , Conn. , firm <unk> & <unk> , <unk> , `` I think he 'll be very good at that { new job } . 
 And much better at that than at { the <unk> } he 's been doing recently . '' 
 Cotton Inc . <unk> 
 Cotton Inc. , the fiber company that represents cotton growers , will begin a new ad campaign , developed by Ogilvy & Mather , <unk> Day . 
 J. Nicholas Hahn , Cotton Inc. 's president and chief executive , was an outspoken critic of WPP Group 's acquisition of Ogilvy Group earlier this year . 
 During the takeover , Mr. Hahn said he would put his account up for review if WPP 's bid were successful , but he did n't . 
 Cotton Inc. 's new $ N million campaign calls cotton the `` <unk> of Our <unk> . '' 
 The campaign <unk> its `` Take <unk> in Cotton '' ads and marks the end of its national cooperative advertising efforts . 
 For years , the company 's ads were tied in with pitches for <unk> sheets or <unk> <unk> , for example , and an announcer at the end of the ads would tell customers where to `` find the true performance label . '' 
 With the new TV spots , Ogilvy & Mather has <unk> for a family style with lots of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . 
 `` We 're making a fairly obvious plea for some emotional reaction , '' says Tom <unk> , creative director at Ogilvy & Mather . 
 Cotton Inc. will spend nearly $ N million on broadcasting on <unk> Day alone , advertising on such programs as `` Good <unk> America , '' `` Macy 's <unk> Day <unk> '' and the NFL holiday game .

 Prime Minister Lee <unk> <unk> , Singapore 's leader and one of Asia 's leading <unk> for N years , recently announced his intention to retire next year -- though not necessarily to end his influence . 
 The prime minister , whose hair is <unk> and gray and whose face has a <unk> <unk> , nonetheless continues to display an energy , a precision of thought and a willingness to say publicly what most other Asian leaders <unk> say only privately . 
 The N Mr. Lee recently spent an hour discussing the state of Asia and the world with two Journal reporters in his <unk> <unk> , <unk> office . 
 The interview did not touch on Singapore 's domestic affairs . 
 <unk> personal <unk> , Mr. Lee picked up exactly where he left off several months earlier -- before the government crackdown in China -- when he had warned that the orthodox leadership in Beijing feared a <unk> of views . 
 <unk> follow : 
 On China 's turmoil : `` It is a very unhappy scene , '' he said . 
 `` It took <unk> <unk> ( former premier and party chief ) N years to build a team of economists who understood how the Western economies work and now that team is part in <unk> , part being <unk> and part missing . '' 
 <unk> that team , Mr. Lee predicted , will take another N years . 
 `` That 's very sad for China and for Asia because China could have been a good engine for growth , not just for Hong Kong and Taiwan but for Japan , Korea and the rest of Asia . '' 
 On <unk> between China and the Soviet Union : `` In important <unk> , the Soviets are different from the Chinese . 
 They are already industrialized ... . 
 Their problem is one of <unk> of an industrial economy . 
 The Chinese problem is much greater -- it 's how to <unk> to begin with . '' 
 Asked if the Soviets , like Chinese officials , wo n't one day face a similar conflict between the desire to <unk> economically and yet retain political control , Mr. Lee said , `` I would think that the Soviets face a deeper dilemma because they have been more in <unk> than the Chinese -- I mean keeping their people cut off from the outside world . '' 
 Mikhail Gorbachev , he said , is ahead of China 's leaders in his awareness of the world . 
 `` But I think the Soviet <unk> are more <unk> than the Chinese . '' 
 <unk> , he said , he still believes the Soviet Union , while falling far short of the efficiency of a Western economy , may well manage to improve considerably . 
 On <unk> prosperity : `` If America can keep up the present situation -- her markets open for another N years , with adjustments , and Japan can grow and not cut back , and so too , Korea , Taiwan , Hong Kong , Singapore , <unk> , Australia and New Zealand -- then in N years , the economies of these countries would be totally restructured to be able to almost sustain growth by themselves . '' 
 In such an arrangement , `` all benefit , '' he said . 
 `` And if the Europeans come in , they benefit too . 
 It 's not a <unk> game . '' 
 Asked about the possibility of greater economic cooperation among <unk> nations , which will be discussed Nov. N and N at a <unk> meeting in <unk> , Mr. Lee said the goal `` is to have a free and open world trading system . '' 
 An Asian bloc is n't intended , he said . 
 `` That 's not possible . '' 
 On <unk> relations : `` I 'm encouraged . 
 I think the earlier <unk> notes struck by { U.S. Commerce Secretary Robert } Mosbacher and { U.S. Trade <unk> } <unk> Hills have been more <unk> . 
 I believe the U.S. is becoming more patient and <unk> , '' he said . 
 `` It 's the total relationship that is important . '' 
 The total relationship , as Mr. Lee sees it , is `` the flow of dollars to the U.S. to fund the deficits , the investments the Japanese are making in the U.S. in order to satisfy American demand that American products consumed in America should be made as much as possible in America by Americans with Japanese technology and capital . '' 
 Japan 's recent political turbulence , Mr. Lee said , may mean Japan will slow market adjustments . 
 `` They 'll be more <unk> in <unk> their own voters , like opening up more to agricultural imports from America , hurting their farmers . '' 
 On U.S. military presence in Asia : Asked if his offer to allow the American military to use facilities in Singapore would help preserve America 's presence in the region at bases in the Philippines , he said , `` What we have done is make it easier for the Philippines to continue to host American bases without it being said they are <unk> of the <unk> and the only ones in Asia or in Southeast Asia . 
 We are willing to share the political burden of being host to America , an <unk> power . 
 We think it is n't such a great burden , that it carries no <unk> , and we are prepared to do it . '' 
 On <unk> relations : `` It 's such a <unk> relationship going back into history ... . 
 I really do not understand how it is that <unk> feel so <unk> involved in this father figure that they want to <unk> of and yet they need . 
 I just do n't understand it . 
 My relationships with the British are totally different . 
 They <unk> it over me . 
 They did me some good . 
 They did themselves even more good . 
 They let me down when the Japanese came down { during World War II } ... . 
 I do n't feel down or done in because I show British <unk> on my television network or read their books . 
 I mean it is a normal adult relationship . 
 `` But the <unk> and the Americans , when I talk to them , there 's so much passion about Filipino <unk> being diminished as a result of being <unk> upon by the Americans and so on . 
 The occasional <unk> tries to put on <unk> but we let it pass ... . 
 It 's just comic when they try to <unk> they 're still the master race . '' 
 Mr. Lee added that the <unk> are `` making it very difficult '' for the U.S. military presence to last beyond five or N years . 
 On military alternatives if the U.S. pulls back : `` The Soviets already are present . 
 I <unk> sooner or later , the Japanese would have to fill up a large part of the gap on the naval side . 
 Maybe the Chinese , maybe even the Indians . '' 
 On economic consequences of a diminished U.S. presence : `` America is the only major power in recent history that has used its military might to sustain a system that <unk> all participants to equally benefit without her as the provider of the security taking royalties . '' 
 Asked why so few nations seem to share his views of America , he said , `` Many people see it that way . 
 But they have just taken it for granted . '' 
 On Cambodia : `` Let 's assume that { former <unk> leader Prince <unk> } <unk> does what the press wants him to do and joins up with { <unk> <unk> leader } <unk> Sen . 
 Is the trouble over ? 
 Can <unk> and <unk> Sen knock off the Khmer Rouge still supported by China ? 
 He ca n't . 
 `` What is the way forward ? 
 To get the Khmer Rouge as part of a process for elections . 
 And when they lose , then we can expect China to stop aid . 
 Let 's put it <unk> . 
 The Chinese can not be seen to have made use of the Khmer Rouge and then <unk> them . ''

 Everything looked good as <unk> Walter Levy and colleagues carefully cut away a woman 's <unk> tumor at the Cleveland <unk> in N . 
 Using small electrical shocks applied to her feet , they were able to monitor <unk> nerves . 
 The shocks generated <unk> <unk> that traveled via <unk> to brain and showed up clearly on a <unk> monitor , indicating no damage to the delicate <unk> tissue . 
 Then , says Dr. Levy , `` she <unk> up <unk> . '' 
 The damage was to her motor nerves , which could n't be monitored along with the <unk> nerves , he explains . 
 The tragedy , he adds , `` galvanized me '' to look for a way to prevent similar cases . 
 Dr. Levy 's answer may come with a new kind of magnetic brain probe , a device that he and dozens of U.S. researchers are studying with great hope . 
 Besides holding the promise of safer <unk> surgery , the probe could improve the <unk> of brain and <unk> disorders such as <unk> and multiple <unk> . 
 Perhaps most exciting , the device is <unk> open a window to the <unk> of the brain . 
 The probe , which is <unk> , <unk> and apparently <unk> , employs strong magnetic fields to induce small <unk> of electricity within the brain . 
 If positioned over the brain 's <unk> area , the <unk> <unk> generate <unk> <unk> that <unk> down motor nerves and <unk> <unk> , making , say , a finger <unk> . 
 In principle , they will enable doctors to check the body 's motor system the way an <unk> tests a home 's electrical circuits by running current through them . 
 `` Until now , we 've had no objective way of measuring motor function , '' says Keith <unk> , a <unk> conducting clinical tests with the devices at Boston 's Massachusetts General Hospital . 
 `` All we could do was tell a patient , ` squeeze my <unk> as hard as you can ' or ` raise your arm . ' 
 `` Under the best circumstances such tests are <unk> ; when a patient is <unk> , they do n't work at all . 
 <unk> brain <unk> started in the early N , when researchers produced <unk> of light in the <unk> field with <unk> . 
 In the N , <unk> <unk> researchers developed magnetic devices to stimulate motor nerves in the hand and other <unk> . 
 But for brain tests , the <unk> machines `` would have required patients to stand on their heads , '' says <unk> <unk> , a researcher at the University of California at San Diego . 
 The field took off in N after scientists at Britain 's <unk> University developed a handy , compact <unk> for brain <unk> . 
 Since then , at least two commercial versions have been put on the U.S. market , and an estimated N have been sold . 
 In August , a Chicago conference on such devices attracted more than N researchers , who reported studies on everything from brain <unk> to physical therapy . 
 `` We do n't feel we can use { the devices } routinely in surgery yet , but we 're getting close , '' says Dr. Levy , who is now with the University of Pittsburgh . 
 A problem , he adds , is that <unk> brains are more <unk> to magnetic <unk> than <unk> ones . 
 The devices could help indicate when surgery would help , says Charles <unk> , a University of Toronto <unk> . 
 For example , <unk> <unk> victims occasionally have some intact <unk> <unk> that , if <unk> by emergency surgery , enable partial recovery . 
 But such operations typically are n't performed because there is no sign right after an injury that surgery would be beneficial . 
 `` The cost { of magnetic <unk> } would seem like <unk> if we could retrieve <unk> function '' in such people , Dr. <unk> says . 
 Scientists caution there is a chance the <unk> technique might spark seizures in <unk> . 
 But no significant problems have been reported among hundreds of people tested with the devices . 
 The main <unk> , besides feeling like a <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> , is `` like a <unk> on the head , '' says Sam <unk> , a <unk> who has studied the brain <unk> at Yale University . 
 One apparent side effect is a minor increase in a brain <unk> . 
 And some doctors who have conducted hours of tests on themselves report temporary <unk> . 
 At least two companies , <unk> Laboratories Inc. of <unk> , Wash. , and <unk> Medical Systems Inc. of <unk> , Conn. , now sell versions of the magnetic devices . 
 The machines , which at $ N are <unk> by medical standards , have n't been approved in the U.S. for marketing as brain <unk> but are sold for <unk> nerves in the hand , <unk> and other <unk> areas . 
 Researchers can apply for permission to use the <unk> for brain studies . 
 At the University of Kentucky , a team led by Dean <unk> , a physical therapy researcher , is testing the <unk> in <unk> with electric shocks to induce muscle <unk> to help prevent <unk> of <unk> <unk> after <unk> surgery . 
 Similarly , a <unk> University team led by heart researcher <unk> <unk> hopes to develop ways to <unk> induce <unk> muscle <unk> . 
 The devices might someday serve as temporary <unk> or <unk> for stopped <unk> , says Dr. <unk> , whose <unk> was dubbed the `` <unk> <unk> . '' 
 The devices ' most remarkable possibilities , though , involve the brain . 
 <unk> with the <unk> , National Institutes of Health scientists recently showed how the brain <unk> <unk> resources after an <unk> . 
 <unk> studies are expected to reveal how <unk> patients ' brains <unk> -- a first step toward finding ways to bolster that process and speed <unk> . 
 Scientists also are exploring memory and perception with the new machines . 
 At the State University of New York at Brooklyn , researchers <unk> two groups of different letters on a computer screen in front of human <unk> pigs . 
 Between <unk> , certain areas in subjects ' brains are jolted with a magnetic <unk> . 
 When the jolt is <unk> just right , the subjects do n't recall seeing the first group of letters . 
 `` Where does that first <unk> go ? '' <unk> <unk> <unk> Paul <unk> . 
 `` <unk> to answer that is suggesting all kinds of theories , '' such as precisely where and how the brain processes <unk> signals from the eyes . 
 He and others say that the machines are weak enough that they do n't jeopardize the memory . 
 Both the <unk> team and researchers at the National <unk> Laboratory in Cambridge , Mass. , are working with more potent magnetic brain <unk> . 
 Among other things , the stronger devices may be able to <unk> forth <unk> memories and induce mood changes , <unk> say . 
 Du Pont Co. , Hewlett-Packard Co. and Los <unk> National Laboratory said they signed a three-year , $ N million agreement to <unk> on <unk> research . 
 The collaboration will include at least N researchers and will be aimed primarily at developing thin films of <unk> <unk> for use in electronics , the companies said . 
 The materials , discovered during the past three years , conduct electricity without resistance and promise smaller , faster computers and other new technologies . 
 <unk> programs have <unk> as U.S. companies seek to spread the risks and costs of <unk> new <unk> and to meet the challenges posed by foreign <unk> , especially in Japan . 
 The latest research pact <unk> Du Pont 's growing portfolio of investments in <unk> . 
 The Wilmington , Del. , chemicals concern previously signed research <unk> agreements with <unk> Ridge National Laboratory and with <unk> National Laboratory . 
 Last year , Du Pont agreed to pay $ N million for rights to <unk> work at the University of Houston . 
 Hewlett-Packard is a Palo Alto , Calif. , computer maker . 
 The Los <unk> laboratory is one of three U.S. Department of Energy national laboratories designed as pilot centers to foster joint <unk> programs to speed the transfer of new <unk> to the marketplace . 
 J.C. <unk> Co. , Dallas , said it issued $ N million of securities backed by credit-card receivables . 
 The offering was priced with an N % coupon rate at N % to yield N % . 
 The retailer said the securities are expected to be rated triple-A by Standard & Poor 's Corp. and <unk> by Moody 's Investors Service Inc . 
 They pay interest only for N months , with principal payments beginning thereafter . 
 The expected average life of the certificates is N years , with the final scheduled payment in October , N . 
 First Boston Corp. is sole underwriter . 
 As part of the transaction , J.C. Penney will sell a portion of its credit-card receivables to its <unk> <unk> Inc. unit , which will then transfer them to a master trust . 
 The trust will issue the certificates . 
 Credit support will be provided by a letter of credit facility from Credit Suisse in favor of the trustee , Fuji Bank & Trust Co. , for the benefit of the certificate holders . 
 J.C. Penney will continue to service the receivables . 
 <unk> Japanese industrial managers here always <unk> up nervous newcomers with the tale of the first of their <unk> to visit Mexico , a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> N years ago . 
 `` From the beginning , it took a man with extraordinary <unk> to succeed in Mexico , '' says <unk> <unk> , president of Mitsui group 's <unk> Engineering Inc. unit . 
 Here in this new center for Japanese assembly plants just across the border from San Diego , turnover is dizzying , infrastructure <unk> , bureaucracy intense . 
 Even <unk> drag ; `` <unk> '' bars , where Japanese <unk> <unk> over recorded music , are prohibited by Mexico 's powerful <unk> union . 
 Still , N Japanese companies , including giants such as <unk> Industries Corp. , <unk> Electronics <unk> Corp. and Sony Corp. have set up shop in the state of Northern <unk> California . 
 <unk> the Japanese happy will be one of the most important tasks facing conservative leader <unk> <unk> when he takes office Nov. N , as the first opposition governor in Mexico 's modern history . 
 Mexico , with its desperate need for investment , and Japan , with its huge budget surplus , would seem like a perfect match . 
 But the two countries remain <unk> by a cultural barrier wider than the ocean . 
 Conservative Japanese investors are put off by what they consider Mexico 's restrictive investment regulations and loose work habits . 
 From the <unk> ' <unk> , <unk> tactics of <unk> Japanese managers do n't count for much in a land where a saying says `` there are no fixed rules . ''
